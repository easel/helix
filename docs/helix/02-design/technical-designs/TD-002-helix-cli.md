# Technical Design: TD-002-helix-cli

**Status**: backfilled
**Backfill Date**: 2026-03-25

## Story Reference

**User Story**: [HELIX CLI wrapper execution] | **Feature**: [FEAT-002-helix-cli] | **Solution Design**: [SD-001-helix-supervisory-control]

## Acceptance Criteria Review

- The wrapper keeps HELIX execution bounded.
- Queue-drain decisions follow the documented control contract.
- Tracker-backed execution remains deterministic and testable.
- Local installation exposes the mirrored HELIX command surface safely.

## Technical Approach
Provide a thin Bash wrapper that keeps HELIX execution bounded, delegates deep
work to documented actions, and gives the repository a local tracker and
launcher without requiring operators to assemble prompts manually.

This design defines the orchestration contract for `helix run`. The wrapper is
not allowed to invent its own workflow policy; it must execute the HELIX
decision model exactly as specified by the authority stack.

## Orchestration Contract

`helix run` is a bounded supervisor around HELIX queue state.

- It always starts from tracker-backed ready work, not from assumptions about
  in-progress work.
- It executes at most one implementation issue per pass.
- It treats `check` as the source of next-step guidance after the ready queue
  drains.
- It keeps alignment and backfill as distinct follow-up actions.
- It does not auto-implement blocked work on `WAIT`.
- It does not silently continue after a review failure.

## Component Changes

### Modified: Wrapper entry and run loop
- **Current State**: Bash wrapper around HELIX actions.
- **Changes**: Enforce bounded execution, queue-drain checks, and review-aware
  cycle control.

### Modified: Tracker integration
- **Current State**: Local JSONL issue tracker.
- **Changes**: Dependency-aware ready/blocked selection, ownership, and
  recovery-aware orchestration.

### Modified: Installer and harness
- **Current State**: Local launcher and deterministic wrapper tests.
- **Changes**: Keep mirrored command install and deterministic verification in
  sync with the wrapper contract.

## State Machine

### Ready Work

When `helix tracker ready --json` reports one or more ready execution issues:

1. Select the best ready execution issue using the tracker ranking rules.
2. Claim the issue.
3. Run one bounded implementation pass for that issue.
4. Verify, commit, and close it when the issue is complete.
5. Count the pass as a completed cycle only if the issue actually closes.

### Queue Drain

When the ready queue is empty, `helix run` must execute `check` once and obey
the first `NEXT_ACTION` result exactly:

- `NEXT_ACTION: IMPLEMENT`
  Re-enter ready-work selection and continue only if the tracker now reports
  ready execution work.
- `NEXT_ACTION: ALIGN`
  Run one alignment pass if auto-alignment is enabled. If the follow-up check
  still returns `ALIGN`, stop and surface the alignment command rather than
  looping forever.
- `NEXT_ACTION: BACKFILL`
  Stop and surface the explicit `helix backfill <scope>` command. Backfill is a
  separate cross-phase action and is not auto-run by `helix run`.
- `NEXT_ACTION: WAIT`
  Stop immediately. `WAIT` means execution is blocked by claimed work or a
  truly external dependency; `helix run` must not attempt an unblock
  implementation pass.
- `NEXT_ACTION: GUIDANCE`
  Stop immediately and surface the required user or stakeholder decision.
- `NEXT_ACTION: STOP`
  Stop cleanly because no actionable work remains for the scope.

### Cycle Accounting

The loop must distinguish between attempted work and completed work.

- `attempted_cycles`: increment when the wrapper starts an implementation
  attempt.
- `completed_cycles`: increment only after implementation succeeds, the issue
  is closed, and post-implementation review passes when review is enabled.
- `--review-every N` and `--max-cycles N` must use `completed_cycles`, not
  attempted cycles.
- Failed implementation attempts do not count toward the cycle limit.

## Recovery and Ownership

`helix run` needs a safe recovery model for crashed or orphaned sessions.

### Ownership Model

Claimed work is advisory state in the tracker, not a license to rewrite the
worktree blindly.

- A claimed execution issue is represented by `status: in_progress` and
  `assignee: helix`.
- The recommended tracker model should also record claim freshness metadata:
  `claimed_at`, `session_id`, and `lease_expires_at`.
- Recovery may only reclaim work when the claim is demonstrably stale or when
  the user explicitly requests recovery.
- Absence of a currently running process is not sufficient evidence that a
  claim is orphaned.

### Recovery Rules

Recovery must be non-destructive by default.

- If the current session owns the claim, resume from the existing worktree
  state.
- If the claim is stale and the worktree changes are clearly attributable to
  the abandoned issue, the wrapper may ask the agent to finish or cleanly
  revert only the affected files.
- The wrapper must not perform a broad `git checkout -- .` or otherwise erase
  unrelated local changes.
- If ownership is ambiguous, the wrapper must stop and surface the blocker
  rather than guessing.
- Recovery results should be visible in the issue notes or a follow-on
  diagnostic issue when cleanup is required.

## Review Handling

Post-implementation review is part of the orchestration contract.

- A clean review allows the loop to continue.
- Review findings must create or reopen follow-up work before the loop
  advances to the next issue.
- Review should be machine-readable enough for the wrapper to distinguish
  `CLEAN` from actionable findings.
- If review cannot be interpreted safely, the loop must stop instead of
  assuming success.

## Components

### 1. Wrapper Entry Script

`scripts/helix` resolves the repository root, selects the workflow library
root, sources the tracker library, opens a session log, parses CLI flags, and
dispatches commands.

### 2. Prompt Builders

Each agent-facing command builds a prompt that points at the authoritative
workflow action file and injects repository-local instructions such as tracker
usage and required output trailers.

### 3. Agent Runner

`run_agent_prompt` supports both Codex and Claude. It prints dry-run commands,
streams Claude progress when possible, and enforces an agent timeout.

### 4. Built-In Tracker Library

`scripts/tracker.sh` stores issues as JSONL in `.helix/issues.jsonl`. It
provides creation, read/update/close flows, dependency management, ready and
blocked queue queries, and tracker health summaries using `jq`.
For this design, it is also the source of truth for claim ownership and claim
freshness metadata when the tracker schema is extended.

### 5. Loop Controller

`run_loop` is the orchestration layer for `helix run`. It:

- checks ready work before implementation
- runs one bounded implementation pass at a time
- calls `check` after the queue drains
- can auto-run alignment once after `ALIGN`
- stops on `WAIT`, `GUIDANCE`, or `STOP`
- stops on `BACKFILL` and surfaces the explicit follow-up command
- can trigger periodic alignment with `--review-every` using completed cycles
- must not attempt an unblock implementation pass after `WAIT`

### 6. Installer

`scripts/install-local-skills.sh` links the HELIX skill entrypoints into
`~/.agents/skills`, mirrors them into `~/.claude/skills` for Claude
compatibility, preserves package-relative access back to the repository's
shared `workflows/` library, makes `scripts/helix` executable, and installs a
local `helix` launcher under `~/.local/bin`.

### 7. Deterministic Test Harness

`tests/helix-cli.sh` creates temporary git workspaces, stubs agent binaries,
seeds tracker state, and verifies command behavior without relying on live
agent sessions.

## Data and Filesystem Surfaces

- Workflow docs root: `workflows/`
- Tracker state: `.helix/issues.jsonl`
- Session logs: `.helix-logs/helix-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS.log`
- Installed launcher: `~/.local/bin/helix`
- Installed skill links: `${CODEX_HOME:-$HOME/.codex}/skills`,
  `${CLAUDE_HOME:-$HOME/.claude}/skills`

## External Dependencies

- Required for normal operation: `bash`, `jq`
- Required per agent choice: `codex` or `claude`
- Optional for swarm mode: `ntm`, `tmux`

## Constraints

- The wrapper is intentionally bounded; it is not allowed to replace the HELIX
  loop with an unconditional `while true`.
- Tracker readiness is dependency-aware.
- Experiment mode must refuse dirty worktrees.
- Backfill must fail if the report trailer is missing or the declared report
  file does not exist.
- `WAIT` is a terminal orchestration result, not a cue to try another
  implementation pass.
- Recovery must preserve unrelated local changes and may not rely on process
  absence alone.
