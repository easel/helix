# Feature Specification: FEAT-002 - HELIX CLI

**Feature ID**: FEAT-002
**Status**: backfilled
**Backfill Date**: 2026-03-25
**Scope**: wrapper CLI, built-in tracker, local installer, and deterministic harness

## Summary

`helix-cli` is the repository's operator-facing wrapper around HELIX actions.
It provides one command surface for bounded execution (`run`, `build`,
`check`, `align`, `backfill`), supervisory steering (`status`, `evolve`,
`design`, `polish`, `review`, `triage`, `experiment`), tracker access
(`tracker`), and helper navigation (`next`). The wrapper must preserve the
HELIX authority stack, keep execution bounded, and make queue-control
semantics explicit, observable, and safe.

## Users

- Repository operators running HELIX actions from a local checkout
- AI-assisted sessions that need a stable shell entrypoint
- Maintainers who need deterministic wrapper tests before changing CLI behavior

## Required Behavior

### Command Surface

The CLI must expose these top-level commands:

- `run`
- `status`
- `build`
- `check`
- `align`
- `backfill`
- `evolve`
- `design`
- `polish`
- `next`
- `review`
- `experiment`
- `triage`
- `commit`
- `tracker`
- `frame`
- `help`

Command aliases: `implement` → `build`, `plan` → `design`,
`tracker migrate` → `tracker import`.

### Execution Model

- `run` must continue only while true ready work exists, then call `check` when
  the queue drains.
- `build` must execute one bounded build pass.
- `status` must report a structured lifecycle snapshot sourced from persisted
  run-controller state.
- `check` must return a `NEXT_ACTION` code used to decide whether to build,
  design, polish, align, backfill, wait, ask for guidance, or stop.
- `run` must treat `NEXT_ACTION` as authoritative:
  - `BUILD`: continue with the next bounded build pass.
  - `DESIGN`: run one bounded design pass, then re-evaluate queue state.
  - `POLISH`: run one bounded issue-refinement pass, then re-evaluate queue
    state.
  - `ALIGN`: run the alignment workflow once, then re-evaluate queue state.
  - `BACKFILL`: stop and surface the explicit `helix backfill <scope>` command
    before execution resumes.
  - `WAIT`: stop without attempting implementation.
  - `GUIDANCE`: stop and surface the required decision.
  - `STOP`: stop because no actionable work remains.
- `run` must support epic focus mode: when an epic is selected, remain on that
  epic's children until it is complete or explicitly blocked.
- `run` must retry difficult work with bounded exponential backoff before
  declaring it blocked.
- `run` must absorb small adjacent work into the current slice when the change
  is clearly part of satisfying the same governing acceptance.
- `run` must capture Codex token-footers even when Codex writes them to stderr
  so token accounting and status reporting do not silently drop usage.
- Only successfully completed build passes count as completed cycles.
- Failed implementation attempts, reviews, alignment, backfill, and recovery
  retries must not be counted as completed cycles.
- `run` must refresh `.helix/context.md` at run start, on epic switch, and at
  least every 5 completed build cycles so long-lived sessions do not execute
  from stale repository context.
- The refreshed context file must include the repository build and test
  commands from the `AGENTS.md` Quick Reference section plus current open,
  in-progress, ready-execution, and closed issue counts.
- After each successful build pass, `run` must perform a fresh-eyes review
  before advancing to the next cycle.
- When `--review-agent` is configured, post-build review must switch to the
  alternate agent for cross-model verification.
- When an epic closes, `run` must perform a scoped post-epic review against
  the epic's governing spec before leaving that scope.
- A review with findings must be surfaced as actionable follow-up before the
  loop advances.
- When parent- and `spec-id`-based sibling detection finds no related ready
  work, `run` must fall back to matching execution-safe siblings by shared
  `area:*` labels before batching unrelated issues together.
- After a failed or timed-out implementation attempt, `run` must clean up
  issue-scoped state before any retry: leave the worktree clean or stop with a
  blocker, and return the issue to `open` when the failed attempt should be
  retried fresh.
- When the loop stops with skipped work, `run` must emit a blocker report and
  persist enough state for `helix status` to explain the stop condition.
- `run` must support `--summary` (or `-s`) mode which routes verbose output to
  the log file only and emits concise progress lines with log-file line-range
  pointers, reducing token consumption when monitored by an outer agent.
- `run` must detect consecutive empty BUILD cycles (check returns BUILD but no
  issue can be selected) and stop after 2 consecutive empties, attempting
  orphan recovery first.
- `run` must use bounded exponential backoff: `min(5 * 2^(attempt-1), 40)`
  seconds, blocking the issue as intractable after 4 failures. The backoff
  delay can be overridden via `HELIX_BACKOFF_SLEEP`.
- When a child issue is blocked as intractable during epic focus, the parent
  epic must also be blocked.

### Tracker Model

- The CLI must expose a built-in tracker at `helix tracker`.
- Tracker data must live in `.helix/issues.jsonl`.
- Ready work must be determined from open issues whose dependencies are all
  closed.
- Tracker creation paths must enforce the required issue fields at creation
  time: `helix` label, one phase label, `--spec-id` for tasks, and
  deterministic `--acceptance` for tasks and epics.
- Tracker ownership must distinguish active claims from stale or orphaned
  claims using `claimed-at` (ISO-8601 UTC timestamp) and `claimed-pid`
  (process ID) metadata recorded on `--claim`.
- `--unclaim` must restore an issue to `open`, clear `assignee`, and null out
  `claimed-at` and `claimed-pid`.
- Orphan recovery must check PID liveness and claim age before reclaiming.
  The staleness threshold defaults to 7200 seconds (2 hours) and is
  configurable via `HELIX_ORPHAN_THRESHOLD`.
- Recovery must preserve unrelated worktree changes — it resets tracker state
  only, it does not revert files.

### Commit

- `commit [issue-id]` must stage all modified files if nothing is staged,
  run the build gate (lefthook, cargo check, or npm test), commit with the
  issue title as the summary, push with rebase, and close the tracker issue.
- `commit` without an issue ID must generate a summary from changed filenames.
- `commit` must fail if there are no changes to commit.
- `commit` must fail if the build gate fails.

### Operator Safeguards

- The experiment flow must require a clean worktree before continuing.
- Backfill output must include machine-readable `BACKFILL_STATUS`,
  `BACKFILL_REPORT`, and `RESEARCH_EPIC` trailers, and the declared report file
  must exist.

### Local Installation

- `scripts/install-local-skills.sh` must install the HELIX skill entrypoints
  into the canonical `~/.agents/skills` location and mirror them into
  `~/.claude/skills` for Claude compatibility.
- The installed skill links must preserve package-relative access back to the
  shared `workflows/` resource library in the HELIX repo.
- The installer must create `~/.local/bin/helix` as a launcher that invokes the
  repository's `scripts/helix`.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Running `helix help` shows the command surface and key options.
- Running `helix status` reports a structured lifecycle snapshot derived from
  persisted run-controller state.
- Running `helix tracker` subcommands supports create/show/update/close/list,
  ready/blocked queries, dependency management, and status summaries.
- Running `helix triage` produces tracker-valid issues with required labels,
  governing artifact reference, and deterministic acceptance criteria.
- Running `helix run` follows the explicit `NEXT_ACTION` contract for
  `BUILD`, `DESIGN`, `POLISH`, `ALIGN`, `BACKFILL`, `WAIT`, `GUIDANCE`, and
  `STOP`.
- Running `helix run` does not attempt implementation after `WAIT`.
- Running `helix run` stops and surfaces the exact backfill command after
  `BACKFILL`.
- Running `helix run` counts only completed build passes as completed
  cycles.
- Running `helix run` captures Codex token usage even when the token footer is
  emitted on stderr.
- Running `helix run` refreshes `.helix/context.md` every 5 completed cycles
  and the refreshed context contains Quick Reference build/test commands plus
  current issue counts.
- Running `helix run` surfaces review findings before the loop advances.
- Running `helix run` stays focused on a chosen epic until the epic finishes
  or an explicit blocker forces release.
- Running `helix run` emits blocker-report output and observability metadata
  for cycle timing and token accounting.
- Running `helix run` batches sibling work by shared `area:*` labels when
  parent and `spec-id` metadata are absent.
- Running `helix run` does not discard unrelated worktree changes during
  recovery.
- Running `helix run` does not retry a failed or timed-out implementation
  attempt with stale claims or leftover issue-scoped worktree state.
- Running `helix run --summary` produces concise one-liner output with
  log-file line-range pointers while routing verbose detail to the log file.
- Running `helix run` stops after 2 consecutive BUILD cycles with no
  selectable issues, attempting orphan recovery before stopping.
- Running `helix run` reclaims orphaned issues when PID is dead and claim age
  exceeds threshold.
- Running `helix run` blocks the parent epic when a child is intractable.
- Running `helix tracker update <id> --claim` records `claimed-at` and
  `claimed-pid` metadata.
- Running `helix tracker update <id> --unclaim` restores `open` status and
  clears claim metadata.
- Running `helix backfill <scope>` enforces the required trailers and durable
  report creation contract.
- Running `bash tests/helix-cli.sh` remains the required deterministic
  verification path for wrapper behavior changes (133 tests).
