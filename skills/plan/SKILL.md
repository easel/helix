# Plan

Create a thorough design document through iterative self-critique and
refinement. Invest deeply in planning quality before any code is written.

## When to Use

- Starting a new feature or project
- Before creating execution beads for a large scope
- When existing planning artifacts are thin or incomplete
- When the implementation path is unclear

## Steps

1. **Load context** — read all existing planning artifacts (vision, PRD,
   architecture, designs), current implementation, and bead queue state.

2. **Draft a comprehensive plan** covering: problem statement, requirements,
   architecture decisions with alternatives, interface contracts, data model,
   error handling, security, test strategy, implementation ordering with
   dependency graph, risk register, and observability.

3. **Refine iteratively** (4-5 rounds minimum) — after each draft round,
   assume there are 80+ elements missed or underspecified. Challenge every
   assumption, interface, error path, and edge case. Track change velocity
   per round.

4. **Detect convergence** — stop when substantive changes drop below 5 for
   two consecutive rounds.

5. **Output the plan** to `docs/helix/02-design/plan-YYYY-MM-DD[-scope].md`.

## After Planning

Run `helix polish` to create and refine beads from the plan, then `helix run`
to execute.
