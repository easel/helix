# HELIX Action: Input

You are processing sparse user intent through the HELIX intake surface.

Your goal is to accept a natural language request, identify the governed work it
affects in the artifact stack, and create or update work items so the rest of
the HELIX workflow can execute the intent without further user prompting.

## Action Input

You receive:

- A natural language request (the user's intent, possibly incomplete or ambiguous)
- An autonomy level: `low`, `medium`, or `high` (default: `medium`)

**Autonomy semantics (FEAT-011 / TD-011)**:

- `low`: Ask the user before proceeding at each step and before creating each
  downstream artifact. Do not infer unconfirmed scope.
- `medium`: Create deterministic non-conflict artifacts. Pause for user input
  when ambiguity or conflict blocks deterministic progress on an affected artifact.
- `high`: Create downstream artifacts without interactive prompts unless blocked
  by a physics-level constraint. Create speculative work items for assumptions
  rather than asking.

## Authority Order

When artifacts disagree, use this precedence:

1. Product Vision
2. Product Requirements
3. Feature Specs / User Stories
4. Architecture / ADRs
5. Solution Designs / Technical Designs
6. Test Plans / Tests
7. Implementation Plans
8. Source Code / Build Artifacts

## STEP 0 — Bootstrap

1. Read AGENTS.md so project instructions are fresh in working memory.
2. Verify the runtime tracker is available.
3. Read `docs/helix/01-frame/` if it exists to load project vision and
   declared concerns.

## STEP 1 — Intent Parsing

Parse the request:

1. Extract the core intent (what the user wants to change, add, or fix).
2. Identify the affected artifact layer (feature, design, bug, etc.).
3. Identify any explicit constraints or references (spec IDs, work item IDs,
   feature names, area labels).
4. If autonomy=low, confirm your interpretation with the user before
   continuing. If autonomy=medium or high, proceed with best-effort
   interpretation and document it.

## STEP 2 — Artifact Graph Traversal

Traverse the artifact stack to find affected artifacts:

1. Search for existing governing work items, features, specs, and designs that
   the request touches.
2. Determine the blast radius: which governed artifacts need to change?
3. If a matching work item already exists (same scope, same intent), prefer
   updating it over creating a duplicate.

## STEP 3 — Work Item Creation / Update

Create or update work items for the identified work:

1. Create new work items for new scope.
2. Refine existing work items when the same scope already has an open item.
3. Assign labels: `helix`, plus `phase:build`, `kind:implementation`, and any
   relevant `area:` labels.
4. Set `spec-id` to the nearest governing artifact (feature, user story, or
   design doc ID).
5. Write concrete, locally verifiable acceptance criteria.
6. Encode blockers when one work item must precede another.
7. After creating a new work item, assemble its context digest per the
   runtime's context-digest reference. Do not leave HELIX-created open work
   items without either a digest or an explicit omission rationale when the
   contract allows omission.

**Autonomy-specific work item creation rules**:

- `low`: Create only the work item the user explicitly confirmed.
- `medium`: Create work items for deterministic downstream work. Flag ambiguous
  scope in descriptions rather than creating speculative items.
- `high`: Create speculative work items for reasonable downstream assumptions;
  label them `kind:speculative` to mark them as assumed, not confirmed.

## STEP 4 — Conflict Detection

Before finishing, check for conflicts:

1. Does this intent contradict an existing higher-authority artifact?
2. Does it duplicate an existing open work item?

If a conflict exists:
- `low` / `medium`: Report the conflict and ask the user how to resolve it.
- `high`: Create an escalation work item labeled `kind:escalation` and proceed
  with the non-conflicting portions of the request.

## STEP 5 — Output

Report what was done:

```
INPUT_STATUS: COMPLETE | NEEDS_CLARIFICATION | BLOCKED
ITEMS_CREATED: N
ITEMS_UPDATED: N
AUTONOMY_LEVEL: low|medium|high
CONFLICTS: <description or "none">
NEXT_ACTION: run implementation loop | check queue | <clarification question>
```

Be precise. If the user's intent was ambiguous and autonomy required you to
pause, state exactly what clarification is needed.

## DDx Integration Appendix

This appendix applies when DDx is the active HELIX runtime.

### Bootstrap

Verify the tracker with `ddx bead status`. If it fails, stop immediately.

### STEP 1 reference

Explicit constraints or references include bead IDs.

### STEP 2 reference

Search for existing governing beads via the tracker.

### STEP 3 — DDx work item operations

```bash
# Create new work item
ddx bead create "<title>" \
  --labels helix,phase:build,kind:implementation \
  --set spec-id=<governing-artifact> \
  --acceptance "<testable criteria>"

# Refine existing work item
ddx bead update <id> ...

# Encode a blocker
ddx bead dep add <blocked-id> <blocking-id>
```

After creating a new bead, assemble its `<context-digest>` per
`.ddx/plugins/helix/workflows/references/context-digest.md`. If the repo ships
`scripts/refresh_context_digests.py`, use it after bead creation so digest
assembly and area labels stay deterministic.

Omission path: if the this action cannot assemble a digest (legacy bead,
incomplete concern mapping), use the exact prefix
`Explicit omission rationale: <reason>`, add label `digest:omission-authorized`,
and set `digest-omission-path=helix-input:legacy-migration`.

**Autonomy-specific bead creation rules** mirror the normative rules above, with
speculative beads labeled `kind:speculative` and escalation beads labeled
`kind:escalation`.
