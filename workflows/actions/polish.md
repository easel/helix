# HELIX Action: Polish Issues

You are performing iterative issue refinement before implementation begins.

"Check your issues N times, implement once."

Your goal is to improve issue quality through multiple refinement passes:
deduplication, coverage verification against the plan, acceptance criteria
sharpening, dependency correction, and convergence detection. This front-loaded
investment prevents expensive rework during implementation.

## Action Input

You may receive:

- no argument (default: all open issues)
- a scope such as `auth`, `FEAT-003`, `phase:build`
- `--rounds N` controlling maximum refinement passes (default: 6)

Examples:

- `helix polish`
- `helix polish auth`
- `helix polish --rounds 10 FEAT-003`

## Tracker Rules

Use the built-in tracker only. Follow:

- See `ddx bead --help` for tracker conventions

Issues are stored in `.ddx/beads.jsonl`.

## PHASE 0 - Load Current State

0. **Context Recovery**: Re-read AGENTS.md so project instructions are fresh
   in your working memory. After long sessions, context compaction may have
   dropped critical project rules. This step is cheap insurance against drift.
0a. **Load active design principles** following `workflows/references/principles-resolution.md`.
   Use them as refinement guidance — flag issues whose scope or criteria
   conflict with the active principles.
0b. **Load active stack and practices** following `workflows/references/stack-resolution.md`.
   Verify issue descriptions and acceptance criteria reference the correct
   stack tools and conventions.
0c. **Refresh context digests**: For each bead in scope that has an existing
   `<context-digest>`, re-assemble per `workflows/references/context-digest.md`
   and update if material changes exist. For beads without a digest, assemble
   one and prepend it.
1. Verify the built-in tracker is available.
   - If `ddx bead status` fails, stop immediately.
2. Load all open issues for the scope.
   - `ddx bead list --status open --json`
   - `ddx bead list --status in_progress --json` (if relevant to scope)
3. Load the governing plan document if one exists.
   - Check `docs/helix/02-design/plan-*.md` for the scope
   - Check other planning artifacts (PRD, feature specs, architecture docs)
4. Record initial issue count and state as the baseline.

## PHASE 1 through N - Refinement Passes

Each pass performs ALL of the following checks. Track changes made per pass.

### Deduplication

- Find issues with overlapping scope, description, or acceptance criteria.
- Merge duplicates into a single canonical issue that preserves the strongest
  elements of each.
- When merging, preserve all dependency relationships from both issues.
- Close the redundant issue with a note pointing to the canonical one.

### Plan Coverage Verification

- If a plan document exists, verify every section has at least one issue.
- If a section has no issue, create one with proper labels, spec-id, and
  acceptance criteria derived from the plan.
- If an issue exists but doesn't map to any plan section, flag it for review.

### Acceptance Criteria Sharpening

- Replace vague criteria with testable statements.
  - Bad: "auth should work correctly"
  - Good: "login with valid credentials returns 200 and a JWT; login with
    invalid credentials returns 401 with error code AUTH_INVALID"
- Ensure every issue has at least one concrete acceptance criterion.
- Add verification method: what command or test proves this criterion is met?

### Dependency Verification

- Verify dependency chains are correct: if issue A depends on issue B, does B
  actually produce what A needs?
- Look for missing dependencies: does this issue assume work that hasn't been
  captured as a dependency?
- Look for circular dependencies and break them.
- Verify `spec-id` points to the correct governing artifact.

### Sizing

- Flag issues that are too large for a single bounded implementation pass.
  An issue is too large if it touches more than 3 files in different subsystems
  or requires more than one architectural decision.
- Split oversized issues into smaller, independently verifiable slices.
- Preserve the dependency ordering when splitting.

### Label Hygiene

- Ensure every issue has the `helix` label.
- Ensure every issue has exactly one phase label (`phase:build`, `phase:deploy`,
  or `phase:iterate`).
- Ensure area labels are present where applicable.
- Ensure `kind:*` labels match the issue's actual type.

## Convergence Detection

Track a change count per round: number of issues modified, created, or merged.

When change count drops below 3 for two consecutive rounds, declare convergence
and stop refinement.

If max rounds is reached without convergence, report the current state and
recommend additional rounds or user guidance.

## Output

Report a summary of all modifications made across rounds, then these trailer
lines:

```
POLISH_STATUS: CONVERGED|IN_PROGRESS
POLISH_ROUNDS: N
ISSUES_MODIFIED: count
ISSUES_CREATED: count
ISSUES_MERGED: count
```

- `CONVERGED`: change velocity dropped below threshold
- `IN_PROGRESS`: max rounds reached but velocity still above threshold
