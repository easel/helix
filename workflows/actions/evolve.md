# HELIX Action: Evolve

You are threading a new requirement through the project's artifact stack.

Your goal is to take a requirement — a feature request, constraint change,
spec amendment, incident learning, or customer feedback — and propagate it
through the governing documents, detect conflicts with existing work, create
properly triaged tracker issues for implementation, and produce a structured
evolution report.

This action modifies governing artifacts. Treat every write with the same
care as a production code change.

## Action Input

You receive:

- A requirement description (natural language or structured)
- Optional: `--scope` to limit blast radius (e.g., `area:wal`, `SD-017`)
- Optional: `--artifact` to target a specific governing artifact
- Optional: `--from` to indicate the requirement source (incident, feedback, etc.)

## Authority Order

When artifacts disagree, use this precedence:

1. Product Vision
2. Product Requirements
3. Feature Specs / User Stories
4. Architecture / ADRs
5. Solution Designs / Technical Designs
6. Test Plans / Tests
7. Implementation Plans
8. Source Code / Build Artifacts

Update higher-authority documents FIRST, then propagate downward. Never
update a lower-authority artifact in a way that contradicts a higher one.

## STEP 0 — Bootstrap

0. **Load active design principles** following the principles-resolution
   reference for this runtime. Use these as scoping guidance when evaluating
   which artifacts need updates and how to resolve judgment calls. Note: the
   evolve action reads principles but never modifies the principles file —
   only the frame action may write it.
0a. **Load active concerns and practices** following the concern-resolution
   reference for this runtime. Concern context affects the scope of downstream
   changes:
   - A requirement that implies a technology change (new language, new framework,
     new runtime, new dependency) must be checked against declared concerns.
   - If the change conflicts with an active concern (e.g., adding a Node.js
     dependency in a `typescript-bun` project, or introducing `println!` logging
     in an `o11y-otel` project), flag it as a conflict requiring an ADR.
   - If the requirement implies adopting a technology that has a library concern
     but the project doesn't yet declare it, include concern selection as part of
     the evolution — create or update `docs/helix/01-frame/concerns.md` alongside
     the other artifact updates.
   - If the requirement removes or replaces a technology covered by an active
     concern, the concern declaration and project overrides must be updated as
     part of Step 4 artifact evolution.
0b. **Context digest**: When this action creates or modifies work items, it
   must assemble a context digest per the runtime's context-digest reference
   and prepend it to the item description. If a repo helper exists for digest
   assembly, use it instead of hand-writing the XML. The concerns element must
   contain matched concern names, never area labels.

## STEP 0.5 — Work Item Acquisition

Before modifying any artifacts, acquire a governing work item for this
evolution pass. See the runtime's work-item acquisition reference for the full
pattern.

## STEP 1 — Requirement Analysis

Parse the input requirement:

1. Identify the core change — what capability, constraint, or behavior is
   being added, changed, or removed.
2. Classify the type: new feature, amendment, constraint, policy change,
   incident remediation.
3. Assess scope: which subsystems, interfaces, and data models are affected.
4. If the requirement is ambiguous, state your interpretation explicitly
   and proceed. Do not halt for clarification on things you can reasonably
   infer.

## STEP 2 — Artifact Discovery

Search the project's doc tree for governing artifacts in scope:

1. Read `AGENTS.md` for the project's artifact structure.
2. Search for artifacts that reference the affected subsystems, interfaces,
   or capabilities.
3. Build an ordered list of artifacts to review, highest authority first.
4. For each artifact, note its current state and the section(s) that will
   need updating.
5. **If the evolution will create new numbered artifacts**, load the relevant
   meta.yml files and determine the next available IDs now — before writing
   anything:
   - **New feature spec (FEAT-NNN)**: read the feature-specification meta.yml,
     scan `docs/helix/01-frame/features/FEAT-*.md`, set next FEAT ID = max + 1
     (use `001` if none exist).
   - **New solution design (SD-NNN)**: read the solution-design meta.yml,
     scan `docs/helix/02-design/solution-designs/SD-*.md`, set next SD ID =
     max + 1.
   - **New technical design (TD-NNN)**: read the technical-design meta.yml,
     scan `docs/helix/02-design/technical-designs/TD-*.md`, set next TD ID =
     max + 1.
   - Record these values. Use them exclusively when assigning IDs; never guess
     or reuse an existing number.

Use commands like:
- `find docs/ -name "*.md" | xargs grep -l "keyword"`
- List open work items from the runtime tracker to find related open items

## STEP 3 — Conflict Detection

For each affected artifact:

1. Read the relevant sections.
2. Check whether the new requirement contradicts existing content.
3. Check whether the new requirement conflicts with open tracker issues.
4. Check whether the new requirement conflicts with active concerns:
   - Does it introduce a tool, framework, or convention that contradicts a
     declared concern's constraints or practices?
   - Does it require a technology not covered by any active concern?
   - Would it change the project's area taxonomy or concern applicability?
5. For each conflict found, record:
   - Artifact and section (or concern name, for concern conflicts)
   - What the artifact or concern currently says
   - What the requirement asks for
   - Whether the conflict is resolvable by reasonable interpretation or
     requires human decision
   - For concern conflicts: whether an ADR is needed to justify the departure

Conflicts that require human decision are flagged but do NOT halt the
entire evolution. Proceed with non-conflicting artifacts.

When a concern conflict is identified, the resolution options are:

- **ADR + concern update**: Create an ADR justifying the technology change,
  then update `concerns.md` to reflect the new selection.
- **Project override**: Add or modify a project override in `concerns.md`
  that documents the exception and its rationale.
- **Reject**: The requirement is incompatible with the project's technology
  commitments and should be reconsidered.

## STEP 4 — Artifact Evolution

For each non-conflicting artifact, in authority order (highest first):

1. Read the current document.
2. Draft the amendment — add, modify, or extend the relevant sections.
3. Validate the amendment does not contradict any higher-authority artifact
   that was already updated in this session.
4. For any **new** artifact being written (not an update to an existing file):
   - Confirm the ID was assigned from the scanned-next-ID computed in Step 2,
     not guessed.
   - Inspect the artifact frontmatter `depends_on` list. For each referenced
     ID, verify the target artifact exists on disk before writing. If a target
     is missing, either remove the dependency or stop and request guidance.
     Never write an artifact with a broken `depends_on` reference.
5. Write the update.
6. If the project uses acceptance manifests (`.acceptance.toml`), update
   those too with new or modified acceptance criteria.
7. If the update touches acceptance artifacts, set
   `NIFLHEIM_ACCEPTANCE_CHANGE=1` before committing.

Keep amendments minimal and scoped. Do not rewrite sections that aren't
affected by the requirement.

## STEP 5 — Work Item Decomposition

Create work items for the implementation work implied by the updated artifacts:

1. For each updated artifact, determine what code changes are needed.
2. Create work items that are individually implementable in one build cycle.
3. Each work item must:
   - carry labels `helix,phase:build,...`
   - set `spec-id` to the updated artifact
   - have deterministic acceptance criteria
4. Set parent if the items belong to an existing epic.
5. Group related items under a new epic if the requirement implies
   multiple implementation slices.

## STEP 6 — Dependency Wiring

Search existing open work items for overlap with the new items:

1. Retrieve the current open item queue from the runtime tracker.
2. For each new item, check if existing items touch the same files,
   subsystems, or acceptance criteria.
3. Add dependency links where ordering matters.
4. If the new requirement supersedes an existing item, record the supersession.

## STEP 7 — Evolution Report and Commit

1. Commit all artifact changes with a message referencing the requirement
   and the governing work item ID.
2. Push to the remote.

## STEP 8 — Measure

Verify the evolution against the governing work item's acceptance criteria.
See the measure action for the full pattern.

1. **Artifact consistency**: All updated artifacts are consistent with each
   other and with higher-authority artifacts.
2. **Conflict resolution**: All resolvable conflicts were resolved; remaining
   conflicts are documented with clear resolution options.
3. **Work item completeness**: Downstream implementation work items were created
   for all code changes implied by the updated artifacts.
4. **Concern threading**: If the requirement introduced or changed a concern,
   verify the concern is properly declared and its practices are referenced
   in new work items.
5. **Record results** on the governing work item via the runtime tracker.

## STEP 9 — Report

Close the evolution cycle and feed back into the planning cycle. See the
report action for the full pattern.

1. If measurement passed, close the governing work item with evidence summary.
2. If conflicts remain, create follow-on work items for each unresolved
   conflict requiring human decision.
3. Output a structured report:

```
## Evolution Report

### Requirement
[summary of the requirement]

### Artifacts Updated
- [artifact]: [what changed]

### Artifacts Skipped (Conflicts)
- [artifact]: [conflict description — what needs human resolution]

### Work Items Created
- [id]: [title] (spec-id: [ref], deps: [ids])

### Dependencies Wired
- [new-id] depends on [existing-id]: [reason]

### Open Conflicts Requiring Human Resolution
- [description with specific artifact references]
```

4. Output the required trailer:

```
EVOLUTION_STATUS: COMPLETE|CONFLICTS|BLOCKED
ARTIFACTS_UPDATED: [count]
ITEMS_CREATED: [count]
CONFLICTS: [count]
MEASURE_STATUS: PASS|FAIL|PARTIAL
ITEM_ID: <governing-item-id>
FOLLOW_ON_CREATED: N
```

`COMPLETE` means all artifacts updated and work items created with no conflicts.
`CONFLICTS` means some artifacts were skipped due to conflicts that need
human resolution, but non-conflicting work was completed.
`BLOCKED` means the requirement fundamentally contradicts the project's
governing artifacts and cannot proceed without human decision.

## DDx Integration Appendix

This appendix applies when DDx is the active HELIX runtime.

### STEP 0 — DDx references

- Principles: `.ddx/plugins/helix/workflows/references/principles-resolution.md`
- Concerns: `.ddx/plugins/helix/workflows/references/concern-resolution.md`
- Context-digest: `.ddx/plugins/helix/workflows/references/context-digest.md`
- Feature-specification meta: `.ddx/plugins/helix/workflows/phases/01-frame/artifacts/feature-specification/meta.yml`
- Solution-design meta: `.ddx/plugins/helix/workflows/phases/02-design/artifacts/solution-design/meta.yml`
- Technical-design meta: `.ddx/plugins/helix/workflows/phases/02-design/artifacts/technical-design/meta.yml`

The `<concerns>` element in a context digest must contain matched concern
names, never `area:*` labels.

### STEP 0.5 — DDx bead acquisition

```bash
ddx bead list --status open --label kind:planning,action:evolve --json

ddx bead update <id> --claim   # if found

# if not found:
ddx bead create "evolve: <requirement summary>" \
  --type task \
  --labels helix,phase:design,kind:planning,action:evolve \
  --description "<context-digest>...</context-digest>
Thread requirement through artifact stack: <requirement description>.
Source: <--from value if provided>" \
  --acceptance "Requirement threaded through all affected artifacts; no unresolved conflicts; downstream beads created with context digests"
```

Record the bead ID. All subsequent artifact modifications are governed by
this bead.

### STEP 2 — DDx find related items

```bash
ddx bead list --json
```

### STEP 6 — DDx dependency wiring

```bash
ddx bead list --status open --json
ddx bead dep add <blocked-id> <blocking-id>
ddx bead update <id> --superseded-by <new-id>
```

### STEP 7 — DDx commit

Commit with a message referencing the requirement and the governing bead ID.

### DDx output trailer

```
EVOLUTION_STATUS: COMPLETE|CONFLICTS|BLOCKED
ARTIFACTS_UPDATED: [count]
ISSUES_CREATED: [count]
CONFLICTS: [count]
