# HELIX Action: Frame

You are creating or refining the highest-authority artifacts in the HELIX
stack: product vision, PRD, feature specifications, and user stories.

These documents govern everything downstream — designs, tests, implementation,
and deployment. Treat every decision here as load-bearing.

## Action Input

You may receive:

- no argument (default: frame the whole project)
- a scope such as `auth`, `payments`, `mobile`

Examples:

- `helix frame`
- `helix frame auth`
- `helix frame "real-time notifications"`

## Authority

Frame-phase artifacts sit at authority levels 1-3:

1. Product Vision (level 1)
2. Product Requirements / PRD (level 2)
3. Feature Specs / User Stories (level 3)

These govern all downstream work. Do not contradict existing higher-level
artifacts unless the scope explicitly asks you to revise them.

## PHASE 0 — Bootstrap

0. **Load active design principles** following `workflows/references/principles-resolution.md`.
   Use them to shape requirements priorities. If no project principles file
   exists, note that you will bootstrap one as part of this frame action.

## PHASE 1 — Discovery

1. Read existing Frame-phase artifacts:
   - `docs/helix/00-discover/product-vision.md`
   - `docs/helix/01-frame/prd.md`
   - `docs/helix/01-frame/features/FEAT-*.md`
2. Read the artifact templates:
   - `workflows/phases/00-discover/artifacts/product-vision/`
   - `workflows/phases/01-frame/artifacts/prd/`
   - `workflows/phases/01-frame/artifacts/feature-specification/`
3. Load numbering rules and determine the next artifact ID:
   - Read `workflows/phases/01-frame/artifacts/feature-specification/meta.yml`
     to understand the ID format (`FEAT-{number}`), naming pattern, and reuse
     policy.
   - List all files matching `docs/helix/01-frame/features/FEAT-*.md`.
   - Extract the numeric portion from each filename, find the maximum N, and
     set **next FEAT ID = N + 1** (use `001` if no files exist yet).
   - Record this value; it is authoritative for every feature spec created in
     this session. Do not guess or reuse an existing number.
4. Identify what exists, what's missing, and what needs updating for the
   requested scope.

## PHASE 2 — Draft

For each missing or outdated artifact:

1. Use the template structure as a guide
2. Draft the content based on:
   - Existing code and docs (if this is an existing project)
   - The user's scope description
   - Industry best practices for the domain
3. Be specific: name target users, state measurable goals, define concrete
   requirements, set explicit non-goals

### Product Vision

Follow the template at `workflows/phases/00-discover/artifacts/product-vision/`.
Read **both** `template.md` (structure) and `prompt.md` (section-by-section
guidance and quality checklist) before drafting.

Key sections: mission statement, positioning, vision, user experience, target
market, value propositions, product principles, success metrics, why now,
non-goals.

### PRD

Follow the template at `workflows/phases/01-frame/artifacts/prd/`.
Read **both** `template.md` (structure) and `prompt.md` (section-by-section
guidance and quality checklist) before drafting.

Key sections: summary, problem & goals, success metrics, non-goals, users &
scope, requirements (P0/P1/P2), functional requirements, constraints &
assumptions, risks, success criteria.

### Feature Specs

For each major capability, create
`docs/helix/01-frame/features/FEAT-NNN-<name>.md` using the **next FEAT ID**
determined in Phase 1 (incrementing by one for each additional spec created
in the same session). Do not pick an ID by guessing — only use the scanned
value.

Before writing each feature spec, validate any `depends_on` entries in its
dun frontmatter:
- Each dependency ID must resolve to an existing artifact on disk (e.g.,
  `prd.md` for a spec that depends on the PRD).
- If a target does not exist, either remove the dependency or stop and
  request guidance before writing the file. Never write an artifact whose
  `depends_on` references a non-existent target.

Key sections: overview, problem statement, functional requirements, user
stories with acceptance criteria, non-functional requirements, constraints.

## PHASE 3 — Iterative Refinement

For each drafted artifact, perform 3-5 rounds of self-critique:

1. Challenge every assumption
2. Check for missing requirements, edge cases, and failure modes
3. Verify non-goals actually exclude what they should
4. Ensure success metrics are measurable
5. Check that feature specs cover the PRD requirements
6. Verify user stories have deterministic acceptance criteria

### Vision-specific critique

If you drafted or updated the product vision, also check:

1. **Positioning**: Does the "For [target]" name a findable group of people?
   Does "Unlike [alternative]" name something real? If either is vague, the
   positioning isn't done.
2. **Vision**: Does it describe an end state or just a market position? "We
   will be the leading X" is a goal, not a vision.
3. **User Experience**: Could someone build a prototype from this scenario? If
   it reads like marketing copy, rewrite it as a usage walkthrough.
4. **Target Market**: Would you know where to find these customers? If "Who"
   is broad enough to include everyone, it's too broad.
5. **Success Definition**: Can you name the tool or process that measures each
   metric? If not, the metric isn't measurable yet.
6. **Why Now**: Does it cite a specific, observable change? "AI is improving"
   is not specific. Name what changed and when.

### PRD-specific critique

If you drafted or updated the PRD, also check:

1. **Problem**: Does it describe a failure mode or just the absence of your
   product? "Users don't have X" is weak. Quantify the pain.
2. **Goals**: Are they state changes or activities? "Build a dashboard" is an
   activity, not a goal.
3. **Success Metrics**: Does every metric have a numeric target and a named
   measurement method? If either is missing, the metric isn't usable.
4. **Non-Goals**: Would someone on the team plausibly argue for including each
   excluded item? If not, the non-goal is a strawman.
5. **P0 Requirements**: Could someone write an acceptance test for each one?
   If not, it's too vague to be P0.
6. **Personas**: Are they specific enough to find a real person who matches?
   Generic roles with generic pain points are templates, not personas.
7. **Risks**: Does every mitigation name a concrete action? "Monitor closely"
   is not a mitigation.
8. **Markers**: Search for `[TBD]`, `[TODO]`, `[NEEDS CLARIFICATION]`. None
   should remain in the committed document.

### Validation gate

After refinement, read `dependencies.yaml` and `prompt.md` from each artifact
directory you touched. Verify all **blocking** quality checks pass. If any
fail, revise the artifact before proceeding to Phase 4. Do not commit an
artifact that fails a blocking check.

## PHASE 3.5 — Principles Bootstrap (if needed)

If no `docs/helix/01-frame/principles.md` exists for this project:

1. Present the HELIX defaults from `workflows/principles.md` to the user.
2. Ask:
   - "What does your project value most?"
   - "What trade-offs do you consistently lean toward?"
   - "What past mistakes should these principles help you avoid?"
3. Synthesize user input and defaults into a project principles document.
4. Check for tensions between principles (see `workflows/references/principles-resolution.md`).
5. Write `docs/helix/01-frame/principles.md`.

Skip this phase if the principles file already exists.

## PHASE 4 — Issue Creation

Create tracker issues for Design-phase work implied by the framing:

- One issue per feature spec that needs a solution design
- Label with `helix,phase:design`
- Set `spec-id` to the feature spec ID
- Set acceptance criteria to "solution design exists and covers feature requirements"

## PHASE 5 — Output

Write all artifacts to their canonical locations and commit.

Report:
1. Artifacts created or updated
2. Key decisions made
3. Open questions requiring stakeholder input
4. Tracker issues created for downstream work
