# HELIX Action: Fresh-Eyes Review

You are performing a self-review of recently completed work, looking for bugs,
omissions, and quality issues with fresh perspective.

After implementing an issue, 1-3 review passes catch bugs that implementation
blindness misses. Each pass focuses on a different failure mode.

## Action Input

You may receive:

- no argument (default: `last-commit`)
- `last-commit` — review the most recent commit
- an issue ID — review all changes associated with that issue
- a file list — review those specific files

Examples:

- `helix review`
- `helix review last-commit`
- `helix review <id>`
- `helix review src/auth/`

## PHASE 0 - Identify Review Target

0. **Context Recovery**: Re-read AGENTS.md so project instructions are fresh
   in your working memory. After long sessions, context compaction may have
   dropped critical project rules. This step is cheap insurance against drift.
0a. **Load active design principles** following `workflows/references/principles-resolution.md`.
   Apply them as review criteria — flag changes that violate the active principles.
1. Determine what was just implemented:
   - If `last-commit` or no argument: `git diff HEAD~1`
   - If issue ID: load the issue, find associated commits via issue ID in commit
     messages, compute the aggregate diff
   - If file paths: review those files in their current state
2. Load the governing artifacts for the reviewed code (acceptance criteria,
   test plans, design docs).

## Pass 1 - Correctness Review

For every changed function or method:

1. Does it handle all error cases documented in the design?
2. Are edge cases covered (empty input, null, boundary values, overflow)?
3. Does it match the acceptance criteria from the governing issue?
4. Are return values and error codes consistent with interface contracts?
5. Are there off-by-one errors, missing bounds checks, or unclosed resources?

For every changed test:

1. Does it actually test what it claims to test?
2. Are assertions specific enough to catch regressions?
3. Could the test pass even if the code were broken (tautological assertion)?
4. Are error paths tested, not just the happy path?

## Pass 2 - Integration Review

1. How do the changes interact with existing code paths?
2. Are there race conditions, deadlocks, or ordering dependencies?
3. Are there missing imports, broken references, or stale caches?
4. Do configuration changes propagate correctly?
5. Are database migrations reversible?
6. Do API changes maintain backward compatibility where required?

## Pass 3 - Security and Performance Review (when applicable)

1. Are there injection vulnerabilities (SQL, command, XSS, template)?
2. Are there authentication or authorization bypasses?
3. Is sensitive data logged, cached, or exposed in error messages?
4. Are there O(n^2) loops, unbounded allocations, or missing pagination?
5. Are there unnecessary network calls in hot paths?

Skip this pass when changes are purely documentation, configuration, or
internal refactoring with no new attack surface or performance impact.

## Pass 4 - Operational Learnings

Review the changes for lessons that should be captured in project operational
docs. This pass ensures that hard-won knowledge is not lost to context
compaction or session boundaries.

1. **AGENTS.md drift**: Do the changes introduce new tools, commands, patterns,
   or conventions that AGENTS.md does not yet document? Are there existing
   AGENTS.md instructions that the changes have made stale or wrong?
   - New CLI commands or flags
   - Changed file paths or directory layout
   - New or removed dependencies
   - Changed testing or CI procedures
   - New conventions for naming, structure, or workflow

2. **Behavioral learnings**: Did this implementation reveal non-obvious
   constraints, failure modes, or gotchas that future agents should know about?
   - Surprising API behavior or edge cases
   - Performance constraints discovered during implementation
   - Configuration interactions that were not obvious from docs
   - Test patterns that proved necessary

3. **Apply updates directly**: If AGENTS.md needs updating and the required
   change is clear from the evidence, make the edit. Do not just recommend it.
   Keep AGENTS.md concise — add actionable instructions, not narrative history.

4. **File learnings issues**: For behavioral learnings that do not belong in
   AGENTS.md (they are project-specific knowledge, not agent instructions),
   create a `kind:backlog` issue with label `source:learnings` capturing the
   insight and its evidence.

Skip this pass only when changes are trivial (typos, formatting, comment-only).

## Output

For each issue found, report:

- **File and line**: exact location
- **Category**: bug, security, performance, correctness, integration, drift
- **Severity**: critical, high, medium, low
- **Description**: what is wrong
- **Suggested fix**: how to resolve it

## Filing Findings as Tracker Issues

After completing all review passes, file each actionable finding (severity
`critical`, `high`, or `medium`) as a tracker issue so that findings are
durable and appear in the ready queue for subsequent execution cycles.

For each actionable finding, create a tracker issue:

```bash
ddx bead create "<category>: <short description>" \
  --type task \
  --labels helix,phase:build,review-finding \
  --spec-id <governing-artifact-or-file-path> \
  --description "Review finding from fresh-eyes review.
File: <file>:<line>
Category: <category>
Severity: <severity>
Description: <full description>
Suggested fix: <suggested fix>" \
  --acceptance "<deterministic verification criteria for the fix>"
```

Rules for filing:
- `low` severity findings: do not file as issues; report them in the output
  only
- Use label `review-finding` on every finding issue for queryability
- Set `--spec-id` to the file path where the finding was identified
- Write deterministic acceptance criteria (e.g., "test X passes", "no SQL
  injection in function Y") so the issue can be closed by automated build

Report these trailer lines at the end of your output:

```
REVIEW_STATUS: CLEAN|ISSUES_FOUND
ISSUES_COUNT: N
FINDINGS_FILED: N
AGENTS_MD_UPDATED: YES|NO
LEARNINGS_FILED: N
```

- `CLEAN`: no issues found across all passes
- `ISSUES_FOUND`: one or more issues identified
- `ISSUES_COUNT`: total number of findings (all severities)
- `FINDINGS_FILED`: number of findings filed as tracker issues (critical+high+medium)
- `AGENTS_MD_UPDATED`: whether AGENTS.md was modified during this review
- `LEARNINGS_FILED`: number of learnings issues created (0 if none)

If issues are found with severity `critical` or `high`, recommend that the
associated issue be reopened or a regression issue be created.
