# Story Test Plan Generation Prompt

Create the canonical story-scoped test plan for one bounded story slice. This
artifact exists because the project-wide `test-plan.md` does not replace the
need for per-story acceptance-to-test traceability.

## Purpose

Story Test Plan is the **story-level executable verification handoff**. Its
unique job is to turn one user story's acceptance criteria and technical design
into concrete failing tests, fixtures, commands, and setup before Build starts.

It inherits the project Test Plan. It does not redefine test strategy, coverage
targets, or feature-wide risk. It owns the exact evidence needed for one story
slice.

## Reference Anchors

Use these local resource summaries as grounding:

- `docs/resources/cucumber-executable-specifications.md` grounds acceptance
  criteria as observable executable examples.
- `docs/resources/google-test-sizes.md` grounds story test levels by scope,
  dependency, and execution cost.

## Storage Location

`docs/helix/03-test/test-plans/STP-{id}-{name}.md`

## What to Include

- the governing `[[US-XXX-*]]` and `[[TD-XXX-*]]` references
- a tight scope statement plus explicit out-of-scope boundaries
- a matrix mapping each active acceptance criterion to concrete failing tests
- executable proof details: test file paths, commands, or named test cases
- setup, fixtures, seed data, mocks, and environment assumptions
- edge cases and error scenarios that the story must prove before build begins
- build handoff notes that help implementation sequence the work

## Minimum Quality Bar

- Stay story-scoped. Do not drift into feature-wide strategy or generic testing doctrine.
- Name runnable evidence, not just test categories.
- Prefer one compact mapping table over repeated prose.
- If an acceptance criterion is not being covered now, say why explicitly.

## Boundary Test

| If you are writing... | Put it in... |
|---|---|
| Project-wide test levels, coverage, and CI gates | Test Plan |
| One story's concrete tests, fixtures, commands, and setup | Story Test Plan |
| Product behavior or acceptance criteria | User Story / Feature Specification |
| Implementation file changes | Technical Design / Implementation Plan |
