# Metrics Dashboard: DepositMatch CSV Import Pilot Readiness

**Review Window**: 2026-05-05 - 2026-05-12
**Baseline**: FEAT-001 pre-release benchmark floor from 2026-05-05
**Status**: complete

## Decision

The latest change improved CSV import validation time and remains within the
FEAT-001 performance target. No performance backlog item is required for this
metric. Continue monitoring during pilot rollout.

## Summary

The representative 10,000-row CSV import validation benchmark improved from
5.8 seconds to 4.4 seconds. The current value is below the 5-second target and
outside the 5% noise band, so the result counts as a meaningful improvement.

## Metrics Table

| Metric | Baseline | Current | Direction | Result | Source |
|--------|----------|---------|-----------|--------|--------|
| `csv-import-validation-seconds` | 5.8 seconds | 4.4 seconds | lower | pass / improved | `docs/helix/06-iterate/metrics/csv-import-validation-seconds.yaml`; `pnpm metric:csv-import-validation -- --fixture fixtures/import/acme-10000-rows` |

## Interpretation Rules

- Values within 5% of baseline are treated as noise.
- Values above 5 seconds violate the FEAT-001 performance target and create an
  improvement backlog candidate.
- Values below target but worse than baseline by more than 5% create a watch
  item, not an automatic build task.

## Trend Notes

- Validation improved after switching row checks to batched normalization before
  persistence.
- No corresponding increase in upload API 5xx rate was observed in staging.
- Pilot rollout should still watch p95 upload response time because production
  file sizes may differ from fixture data.

## Follow-Up

- No immediate improvement issue.
- Continue pilot monitoring through the deployment checklist signals.
- Re-run the benchmark after adding column mapping and row-level validation
  stories.
