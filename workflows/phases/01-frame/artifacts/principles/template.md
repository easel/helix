# Project Principles

These principles guide judgment calls across all HELIX phases. They are not
workflow rules or process enforcement — they are lenses applied when choosing
between two valid options.

This document was bootstrapped from HELIX defaults. You own it now — add,
modify, reorder, or remove any principle. The only constraint: principles
cannot negate HELIX mechanics (artifact hierarchy, phase gates, tracker
semantics).

## Principles

1. **Design for change** — Prefer structures that are easy to modify over
   structures that are easy to describe today.

2. **Design for simplicity** — Start with the minimal viable approach.
   Additional complexity requires justification.

3. **Validate your work** — Every change should be verified through the most
   appropriate means available (tests, type checks, manual verification).

4. **Make intent explicit** — Code, configuration, and documentation should
   make the *why* visible, not just the *what*.

5. **Prefer reversible decisions** — When uncertain, choose the option that
   is easiest to undo or change later.

## Tension Resolution

When principles pull in opposite directions, document the resolution strategy
here. Each entry should name the two principles, describe when they conflict,
and state how to decide.

*No tensions identified yet. As you add project-specific principles, use this
section to resolve any conflicts with existing principles.*
