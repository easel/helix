# Story Test Plan: TP-XXX-[story-name]

## Story Reference

**User Story**: [[US-XXX-[story-name]]]
**Technical Design**: [[TD-XXX-[story-name]]]
**Related Solution Design**: [[SD-XXX-[feature-name]]] or N/A

## Scope and Objective

**Goal**: [What this story must prove before build starts]

**In Scope**
- [Bounded behavior this TP governs]

**Out of Scope**
- [Adjacent behavior intentionally left to another TP, feature, or future slice]

## Acceptance Criteria Test Mapping

| Acceptance Criterion | Failing Test(s) to Create or Run | Test Level | File or Command | Setup / Data | Notes |
|----------------------|----------------------------------|------------|-----------------|--------------|-------|
| [Given/When/Then criterion] | `[test_name]` | Unit / Integration / Contract / E2E | `tests/...` or `bash ...` | [Fixture, seed, mock] | [Edge case or sequencing note] |

## Executable Proof

### Primary Commands

```bash
[command that proves this TP]
```

### Planned Test Files

- `tests/...`
- `tests/...`

### Coverage Focus

- P0: [Must-pass behavior]
- P1: [Important secondary behavior]

## Data and Setup

| Need | Required For | Source / Strategy |
|------|--------------|-------------------|
| [Fixture / seed / mock / env var] | [Tests] | [Where it comes from] |

## Edge Cases and Failure Modes

- [Boundary value or empty-state handling]
- [Validation failure or invalid input]
- [Dependency failure, timeout, or permission edge]

## Build Handoff

**Implementation Order**
1. [What should be implemented first to turn the first red test green]
2. [What follows once the core path passes]

**Constraints**
- [Constraint inherited from requirements, design, concern, or contract]

**Done When**
- [ ] Every in-scope acceptance criterion has passing evidence
- [ ] Named commands or test files exist and run
- [ ] Out-of-scope coverage remains explicitly deferred rather than silently skipped

## Review Checklist

- [ ] References the governing story and technical design
- [ ] Every active acceptance criterion maps to concrete failing tests
- [ ] File paths, commands, or test identifiers are specific enough to execute
- [ ] Setup, fixtures, mocks, and seed data are explicit
- [ ] Edge cases cover real story risks rather than generic boilerplate
- [ ] Scope remains bounded to one story slice
- [ ] Build handoff gives implementation a usable sequence
