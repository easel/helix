## Core Commands

### Bootstrap

```bash
ddx bead init
ddx install helix
helix doctor --fix
```

Installed agent skills mirror CLI commands exactly: `helix-<command>` maps to
`helix <command>`.

Canonical project package path: `./.agents/skills`
Canonical user install path: `~/.agents/skills`
Claude compatibility path: `~/.claude/skills`

HELIX-specific execution behavior lives in the workflow contract and wrapper
commands, not in the portable skill packaging layer.

### Execution Commands

```bash
helix input "natural language request"
ddx agent execute-loop
ddx agent execute-loop --once
ddx agent execute-bead hx-abc123
helix run
helix build
helix build hx-abc123
helix check repo
helix align repo
helix backfill repo
helix status
helix evolve "requirement description"
helix triage "Issue title" --type task
```

Preferred default path:

1. `helix input "..."` for sparse intent or missing bead shaping
2. `ddx agent execute-loop` for execution-ready queue drain
3. `helix check`, `helix review`, `helix align`, `helix design`, or
   `helix polish` when HELIX must interpret or route the next action

`ddx agent execute-loop` is the primary queue-drain command for
execution-ready beads. `helix run` and `helix build` remain compatibility
surfaces where HELIX still adds supervisory policy or operator convenience.
New quickstarts and demos should prefer the default path above.

Execution-ready beads must carry deterministic acceptance and
success-measurement criteria: exact commands, named checks, or observable repo
state that DDx-managed execution can use to decide success without hidden human
interpretation.

### Planning and Quality Commands

```bash
helix input "natural language request"
helix input "natural language request" --autonomy high
helix design [scope]                  # create design document
helix design --rounds 8 auth         # more refinement rounds
helix polish [scope]                  # refine issues before implementation
helix polish --rounds 10              # more polish rounds
helix next                            # recommended next issue
helix review [scope]                  # fresh-eyes review of recent work
helix experiment [issue-id|goal]      # one experiment iteration
helix experiment --close              # squash-merge and close session
```

`helix input` is the sparse-intent entrypoint for the autonomy-slider workflow.
`--autonomy` selects the HELIX-owned behavior contract (`low`, `medium`, `high`); the expected default is `medium` when no override is supplied.


### Tracker

```bash
ddx bead ready --json
ddx bead update <id> --claim
ddx bead show <id>
ddx bead dep tree <id>
ddx bead blocked --json
ddx bead close <id>
ddx bead status
ddx bead import --from jsonl --file .ddx/beads.jsonl
ddx bead export
```

See `ddx bead --help` for full tracker conventions and setup guidance.

## Tracker Labeling

Labels are organizational conventions for triage and traceability. They are
not required by the execution loop queue guard.

Recommended labels:
- `helix` -- identifies HELIX-managed issues (recommended, not required by the queue guard).
- Phase labels: `phase:frame`, `phase:design`, `phase:test`, `phase:build`, `phase:deploy`, `phase:iterate`, `phase:review`.
- Kind labels: `kind:build`, `kind:deploy`, `kind:backlog`, `kind:review`.
- Traceability labels: `story:US-XXX`, `feature:FEAT-XXX`, `area:<name>`, `source:metrics`.

## Decision Guide

- Starting new work or a large scope:
  run `helix design`, then `helix polish`, then `ddx agent execute-loop`
  (or `helix run` when you need the compatibility wrapper's routing behavior).
- Starting from sparse user intent instead of a pre-shaped issue:
  run `helix input "..."` and, when needed, set `--autonomy low|medium|high`.
- Ready execution issues exist:
  run `ddx agent execute-loop`; use `helix build` for an explicit single-bead
  managed attempt or `helix run` when HELIX compatibility routing is still
  required.
- Work lacks design authority for safe execution:
  run `helix design`, or let `helix run` dispatch it from `check`.
- Specs changed and open work needs issue refinement before implementation:
  run `helix polish`, or let `helix run` dispatch it from `check`.
- No ready execution issue, but the planning stack exists and next work is
  unclear:
  run alignment; this creates or claims the governing alignment bead and then
  runs the stored prompt.
- Canonical docs are missing or too incomplete to execute safely:
  run backfill.
- Work exists but is blocked or already in progress:
  stop and wait.
- The queue drains:
  run `check`, not a blind loop and not `ddx bead list --ready`.
- After implementing an issue:
  run `helix review` for fresh-eyes quality check.

## Artifact Inputs

Use the prompts and templates under:

- `.ddx/plugins/helix/workflows/phases/00-discover/artifacts/`
- `.ddx/plugins/helix/workflows/phases/01-frame/artifacts/`
- `.ddx/plugins/helix/workflows/phases/02-design/artifacts/`
- `.ddx/plugins/helix/workflows/phases/03-test/artifacts/`
- `.ddx/plugins/helix/workflows/phases/04-build/artifacts/`
- `.ddx/plugins/helix/workflows/phases/05-deploy/artifacts/`
- `.ddx/plugins/helix/workflows/phases/06-iterate/artifacts/`

Those artifact directories support the canonical docs under `docs/helix/`; they
do not replace the bounded execution contract.

## Output Reports

- Alignment reviews:

- Backfill reports:
  `docs/helix/06-iterate/backfill-reports/BF-YYYY-MM-DD[-scope].md`

## Validation

When changing HELIX wrapper behavior, skill packaging docs, or the execution
contract:

```bash
bash tests/helix-cli.sh
bash tests/validate-skills.sh
git diff --check
```
