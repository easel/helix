Cross-cutting concerns are a core concept in HELIX. They capture technology
choices, quality requirements, and conventions that cut across phases, beads,
and artifacts — and they do it declaratively, so agents can load the right
context without being told twice.

## The Problem Concerns Solve

In a multi-phase, multi-agent workflow, the same decisions need to be honored
everywhere:

- "We use Bun, not Node" affects build scripts, test runners, CI, and design docs.
- "OWASP Top 10 compliance" affects every endpoint, every input handler, every
  dependency choice.
- "OpenTelemetry tracing" affects middleware, error paths, and deployment config.

Without a mechanism to declare these once and inject them everywhere, each
agent invocation risks rediscovering (or contradicting) a prior decision.
Concerns are that mechanism.

## How They Work

1. **Declare** — During [Frame](/docs/workflow#phases), list active concerns
   in `docs/helix/01-frame/concerns.md`
2. **Filter** — Each concern declares which areas it applies to (`all`, `ui`,
   `api`, `data`, `infra`, `cli`)
3. **Inject** — At execution time, HELIX loads area-matched concerns and their
   practices into the agent's context
4. **Digest** — Context digests carry concern practices into individual beads,
   making each work item self-contained

## Concern Library

HELIX ships a library of concerns under `workflows/concerns/`. Each concern
consists of two files:

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `concern.md` | Category, areas, components, constraints, quality gates |
| `practices.md` | Phase-specific practices (requirements, design, implementation, testing) |

### Tech Stack Concerns

| Concern | Key Tools |
|---------|-----------|
| **rust-cargo** | Cargo workspace, clippy, cargo-deny, proptest |
| **typescript-bun** | Bun runtime, Biome, bun:test, strict tsconfig |
| **python-uv** | uv, ruff, pyright, pytest + hypothesis |
| **go-std** | gofmt, go vet, golangci-lint, govulncheck |
| **scala-sbt** | sbt-dynver, scalafmt, scalafix, ScalaTest |
| **react-nextjs** | React 19, Next.js, functional components + hooks |

### Quality and Infrastructure Concerns

| Concern | Focus |
|---------|-------|
| **security-owasp** | OWASP Top 10, dependency auditing, secret management |
| **o11y-otel** | OpenTelemetry tracing, structured logging, metrics |
| **a11y-wcag-aa** | WCAG 2.1 AA, semantic HTML, keyboard navigation |
| **i18n-icu** | ICU message format, locale-aware formatting |
| **testing** | Test philosophy, bug-finding over proof, property-based testing |
| **ux-radix** | Radix UI headless primitives, accessible by default |
| **k8s-kind** | Kubernetes with kind, Helm charts, service discovery |

### Testing Concerns

| Concern | Focus |
|---------|-------|
| **e2e-playwright** | Playwright browser automation, visual regression |
| **e2e-kind** | Kind cluster E2E testing for APIs and infrastructure |

### Tooling Concerns

| Concern | Focus |
|---------|-------|
| **hugo-hextra** | Hugo + Hextra theme, GitHub Pages deployment |
| **demo-asciinema** | Scripted terminal recordings, Docker reproducibility |
| **demo-playwright** | Browser demo recordings with Playwright video capture |

component listings and all available concerns.

## Drift Detection

Tech-stack concerns declare **drift signals** — patterns that indicate the
project is straying from its declared technology choices. For example, the
`typescript-bun` concern flags `npm run` instead of `bun run`, `eslint`
instead of Biome, and `jest` instead of `bun:test`.

HELIX checks for drift signals during [review](/docs/glossary/actions#review)
and [align](/docs/glossary/actions#align), reporting findings that keep the
project honest to its own decisions.

## The Knowledge Chain

Concerns connect to the rest of the HELIX artifact graph through a knowledge
chain:

```
Spike/POC (gather evidence)
  → ADR (record decision with rationale)
    → Concern (index for context assembly)
      → Context Digest (injected into beads)
```

When a referenced ADR is superseded, [polish](/docs/glossary/actions#polish)
flags the affected concern for re-evaluation — ensuring that decisions
propagate forward rather than silently going stale.

## Where Concerns Are Used

Every HELIX action that involves technology or quality choices loads active
concerns:

| Action | How it uses concerns |
|--------|---------------------|
| **build** | Loads practices, runs concern-declared quality gates |
| **review** | Checks for drift signals and practice violations |
| **design** | Concerns constrain architecture decisions |
| **evolve** | Detects technology changes conflicting with concerns |
| **align** | Flags concern drift across all layers |
| **frame** | Concern selection happens during framing |

library catalog and project configuration format.
