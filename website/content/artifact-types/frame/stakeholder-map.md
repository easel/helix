## RACI Matrix

| Activity/Decision | Product Lead | Engineering Lead | Compliance/Legal | Pilot Firm Lead | Sponsor |
|-------------------|--------------|------------------|------------------|-----------------|---------|
| PRD scope approval | A | R | C | C | I |
| CSV import feasibility | C | A/R | I | C | I |
| Live-data pilot approval | C | R | A | I | I |
| Pilot success metrics | A/R | C | C | C | I |
| Budget continuation | R | C | C | I | A |
| Release readiness | A | R | C | I | I |

**R** = Responsible | **A** = Accountable | **C** = Consulted | **I** = Informed

## Power/Interest Grid

```
High Power  | Keep Satisfied      | Manage Closely
            | - Sponsor           | - Product Lead
            |                     | - Engineering Lead
            |                     | - Compliance/Legal
            |---------------------|-------------------
Low Power   | Monitor             | Keep Informed
            | - Support Ops       | - Pilot Firm Leads
            |                     | - Security Champion
            Low Interest          High Interest
```

## Communication Plan

| Stakeholder Group | Channel | Frequency | Content | Owner |
|-------------------|---------|-----------|---------|-------|
| Product + Engineering | Pilot readiness review | Weekly | Scope, risks, import findings, security work | Product Lead |
| Compliance/Legal | Counsel checkpoint | Before live-data pilot, then as needed | Applicability gaps, data handling, vendor review | Compliance Officer |
| Pilot Firm Leads | Interview / pilot feedback session | During research and weekly pilot | Workflow pain, CSV samples, time saved, trust concerns | Product Lead |
| Sponsor / Finance | Sponsor review | Monthly or gate-based | Business Case confidence, pricing signal, pilot cost | Product Lead |

### Escalation Path

1. Artifact owner resolves routine disagreements.
2. Product Lead decides scope tradeoffs within approved pilot boundaries.
3. Compliance/Legal has stop authority for live-data use.
4. Sponsor decides funding continuation or project stop when risk exceeds pilot
   appetite.

Map the stakeholders who matter most to the project and how to engage them.

## Reference Anchors

Use this local resource summary as grounding:

- `docs/resources/atlassian-raci-chart.md` grounds responsibility assignment,
  accountability, consultation, and informed stakeholders.

## Focus
- Identify primary and secondary stakeholders.
- Keep influence, interest, and communication needs clear.
- Note escalation paths without overexplaining them.
- Use roles when names or contact details are unknown. Do not invent people or emails.

## Role Boundary

Stakeholder Map is not a communication log or org chart. It names who has
influence, who needs input or updates, who is accountable for decisions, and
where unresolved decisions escalate.

## Completion Criteria
- Stakeholders are named and categorized.
- Communication is actionable.
- The map stays compact.
- Every critical decision has exactly one accountable role in the RACI matrix.</code></pre></details></td></tr>
