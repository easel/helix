## Purpose

Answers: **Is this the right problem to solve?** Keep the canvas to one page and centered on the decision.

The Opportunity Canvas is not the Product Vision, Business Case, Competitive
Analysis, or PRD. It synthesizes those inputs into a go/no-go gate before
Frame. It owns problem-solution fit and readiness to create requirements.

## Authoring guidance

- **Start with the problem** - validate customer pain before proposing a solution.
- **Be specific about customers** - name exact segments and alternatives.
- **Define clear success** - use measurable metrics with realistic timelines.
- **Show evidence confidence** - distinguish validated facts from assumptions.
- **Keep the solution thin** - describe the minimum concept needed to test fit.
- **Be honest about advantage** - if the advantage is weak, say what must be built.

# Opportunity Canvas

## Problem Statement

| Aspect | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Problem | Small bookkeeping firms lose reviewer capacity to manual deposit-to-invoice reconciliation. |
| Who | Bookkeeping firms with 5-25 employees and recurring small-business clients. |
| Impact | Weekly close work stretches across spreadsheets, exports, and email follow-up. |
| Evidence / Confidence | Product Vision and Competitive Analysis assumptions; validate through pilot interviews. |

**Problem Hypothesis**: Bookkeeping firms will adopt a focused reconciliation
workspace if it reduces weekly client reconciliation below 3 minutes per client
without hiding match evidence from reviewers.

## Customer Segments

| Segment | Priority | Size / Confidence | Characteristics | Current Solution |
|---------|----------|-------------------|-----------------|------------------|
| Multi-client bookkeeping firms | P0 | Medium-sized niche, medium confidence | 5-25 employees, recurring client close cycles, spreadsheet-heavy review | Accounting exports, bank reports, spreadsheets, email |
| Solo bookkeepers with growing client lists | P1 | Unknown, low confidence | Capacity constrained but more price sensitive | Spreadsheets and native accounting reports |

**Early Adopters**: Firms that already export bank and invoice data weekly, have
one reviewer handling multiple clients, and can name specific reconciliation
bottlenecks from the last close cycle.

## Unique Value

| Value Proposition | Customer Benefit | Proof Point |
|-------------------|------------------|-------------|
| Evidence-backed suggested matches | Reviewers can approve quickly without losing auditability. | Product Vision target: accepted suggestions above 95% in review samples. |
| Exception ownership by client | Unclear deposits stay visible until resolved. | Product Vision target: 90% of unresolved deposits have an owner and next action. |
| CSV-first onboarding | Firms can test value before bank-feed integrations. | Business Case recommends a three-month bounded pilot. |

**Elevator Pitch**: DepositMatch gives small bookkeeping firms a trustworthy
review queue for deposit reconciliation. It turns CSV exports into suggested
matches, visible evidence, and owned exceptions without replacing the ledger.

## Customer Fit

| Customer Job / Pain / Gain | Solution Response | Evidence / Confidence |
|----------------------------|-------------------|-----------------------|
| Close weekly reconciliation across many clients | Cross-client review queue | Product Vision, medium confidence |
| Avoid approving matches without proof | Evidence visible before acceptance | Product Vision and Competitive Analysis, medium confidence |
| Preserve follow-up work by client | Exception ownership and next actions | Product Vision, medium confidence |
| Start without integration work | CSV import and mapping | Business Case, medium confidence |

## Solution Concept

| Capability | Problem Addressed | Priority |
|------------|-------------------|----------|
| CSV import and column mapping | Gets firm data into the workspace quickly. | P0 |
| Suggested deposit-to-invoice matches with evidence | Reduces manual searching while preserving reviewer control. | P0 |
| Client-scoped exception queue | Keeps unresolved deposits owned and visible. | P0 |
| Review log export | Supports client questions and month-end auditability. | P1 |

**NOT in Scope**: Bank-feed integrations, accounting-ledger writeback, automatic
approval, payment collection, or replacing QuickBooks/Xero.

## Key Metrics

| Metric | Type | Target | Timeline |
|--------|------|--------|----------|
| Median weekly reconciliation time | Outcome | Below 3 minutes per client | Month 2 of pilot |
| Accepted suggestion accuracy | Quality | Above 95% in reviewer audit samples | Month 2 of pilot |
| Exception ownership | Leading | 90% of unresolved deposits have owner and next action | First month |
| Pilot conversion signal | Business | 3 of 5 pilot firms willing to pay at target pricing | End of pilot |

**North Star Metric**: Median weekly reconciliation time per client.

## Unfair Advantage

| Advantage Type | Our Position | Sustainability |
|----------------|--------------|----------------|
| Workflow focus | Narrow reconciliation review across clients rather than broad ledger management. | Medium |
| Trust model | Evidence-first suggestions instead of opaque automation. | Medium |
| Onboarding path | CSV-first pilot avoids integration delay. | Low |

**Honest Assessment**: The current advantage is focus, not a hard moat. It
becomes stronger only if pilot learning produces better mapping defaults,
review patterns, and exception workflows than generic tools can copy quickly.

## Go/No-Go Decision

| Gate | Status | Evidence / Gap |
|------|--------|----------------|
| Problem validated | Risk | Strong internal hypothesis; needs pilot interviews. |
| Segment reachable | Risk | Target segment is specific; recruiting channel still unvalidated. |
| Value differentiated | Pass | Competitive Analysis identifies trust-first review and exception ownership. |
| Metrics measurable | Pass | Product Vision defines time, accuracy, and exception targets. |
| Risks bounded | Pass | Business Case limits the first investment to a three-month CSV-first pilot. |

**Decision**: Go

**Rationale**: The opportunity is clear enough to enter Frame because the
target customer, problem, differentiators, and pilot metrics are specific. The
main uncertainties are recruiting and willingness to pay, so Frame should keep
the first scope focused on pilot validation.

**Next Action**: Proceed to Frame with explicit research and pilot-validation
requirements.

The Opportunity Canvas is not the Product Vision, Business Case, Competitive

## Key Principles

- **Start with the problem** - validate customer pain before proposing a solution.
- **Be specific about customers** - name exact segments and alternatives.
- **Define clear success** - use measurable metrics with realistic timelines.
- **Show evidence confidence** - distinguish validated facts from assumptions.
- **Keep the solution thin** - describe the minimum concept needed to test fit.
- **Be honest about advantage** - if the advantage is weak, say what must be built.
