# Data Design

## Data Summary

- Scope: DepositMatch CSV import, match review, exception ownership, and review
  log export for the CSV-first pilot.
- Storage systems: PostgreSQL for normalized records and audit data; object
  storage for temporary source CSV files.
- Main concerns: firm/client isolation, import validation, audit integrity,
  retention, restricted telemetry, and reversible schema migration.

## Entities and Stores

| Entity or Store | Purpose | Key Fields | Volume / Growth | Notes |
|-----------------|---------|------------|-----------------|-------|
| Firm | Tenant boundary for staff, clients, imports, and records | id, name, status | Low; one per pilot firm | All customer data scopes through firm_id |
| Client | Customer business managed by a firm | id, firm_id, name, status | 5-25 per pilot firm | Required for exception grouping |
| Import Batch | One uploaded CSV set for a client and period | id, firm_id, client_id, type, status, uploaded_by, source_file_ref | Weekly per client | Stores processing state, not raw CSV content |
| Deposit Record | Normalized bank deposit row | id, firm_id, client_id, batch_id, amount, date, payer_ref, normalized_hash | Hundreds per client/week | Restricted financial data |
| Invoice Record | Normalized invoice export row | id, firm_id, client_id, batch_id, invoice_ref, amount_due, due_date, payer_ref | Hundreds per client/week | Restricted business/customer data |
| Match Suggestion | Candidate link between deposit and invoice records | id, firm_id, client_id, deposit_id, invoice_id, confidence, evidence_json, status | Derived per import | Must be reviewable before acceptance |
| Review Decision | Reviewer action on a suggestion or exception | id, firm_id, client_id, actor_id, action, source_refs, created_at | Grows with review activity | Audit record; immutable after write |
| Exception Item | Unresolved deposit needing ownership and next action | id, firm_id, client_id, deposit_id, owner_id, next_action, status, due_at | Small subset of deposits | Drives follow-up queue |
| Source File Object | Temporary original CSV file | object_key, firm_id, client_id, batch_id, retention_until | Short-lived | Delete according to retention policy |

## Relationships

| From | To | Type | Cardinality | On Delete |
|------|----|------|-------------|-----------|
| Firm | Client | 1:N | Required | RESTRICT |
| Client | Import Batch | 1:N | Required | RESTRICT |
| Import Batch | Deposit Record | 1:N | Optional by batch type | RESTRICT |
| Import Batch | Invoice Record | 1:N | Optional by batch type | RESTRICT |
| Deposit Record | Match Suggestion | 1:N | Optional | RESTRICT |
| Invoice Record | Match Suggestion | 1:N | Optional | RESTRICT |
| Match Suggestion | Review Decision | 1:N | Optional | RESTRICT |
| Deposit Record | Exception Item | 1:0..1 | Optional | RESTRICT |

## Access Patterns and Constraints

| Access Pattern | Frequency | Performance Need | Supporting Index or Cache |
|----------------|-----------|------------------|---------------------------|
| List imports by firm/client/status | Daily per reviewer | <500 ms for pilot scale | `(firm_id, client_id, status, created_at)` |
| Load review queue for a client | Weekly per client | <1 s for hundreds of suggestions | `(firm_id, client_id, status, confidence)` |
| Accept or reject a match | Many per review session | Transactional write with audit record | Transaction on suggestion + review_decision |
| List open exceptions by owner/client | Daily | <500 ms | `(firm_id, owner_id, status, due_at)` |
| Export review log by client/date range | Weekly/monthly | Async if large | `(firm_id, client_id, created_at)` on review decisions |
| Delete expired source files | Daily job | Complete within maintenance window | object metadata: retention_until |

## Validation and Security

| Field or Data Type | Rules / Classification | Protection or Error Handling |
|--------------------|------------------------|------------------------------|
| firm_id/client_id | Tenant and client boundary | Required in every restricted table and authorization query |
| source CSV object | Restricted financial data | Encrypt, short retention, delete after retention_until |
| amount/date/payer_ref | Restricted financial/customer data | Validate type and bounds; avoid telemetry/logging raw values |
| evidence_json | Audit-supporting evidence | Store source row references and normalized evidence, not unnecessary raw file content |
| Review Decision | Audit record | Append-only; corrections create new decisions |
| normalized_hash | Deduplication support | Use for duplicate detection; do not expose to users |

## Migration Strategy

- Tooling: Versioned database migrations committed with application code.
- Approach: Use additive migrations for pilot tables before enabling writes.
  Avoid destructive schema changes during pilot. For breaking changes, expand
  schema first, migrate/backfill data, update code, then contract only after
  old readers/writers are gone.
- Backfill or cleanup: Import batches may require cleanup jobs for expired
  source files and failed partial imports. Backfills must be idempotent and
  firm-scoped.
- Rollback: Application rollback must remain compatible with additive schema
  changes. Destructive changes require a separate rollback plan and explicit
  approval.

Document the data model and access patterns needed to support the design.

## Reference Anchors

Use this local resource summary as grounding:

- `docs/resources/fowler-evolutionary-database-design.md` grounds schema
  evolution, versioned migrations, data movement, and rollback expectations.

## Focus
- Name the main entities, stores, and key fields.
- Make relationships, lifecycle, and integrity constraints explicit.
- Capture the main access patterns and their performance or consistency needs.
- Note privacy, classification, retention, and protection consequences where they
  materially shape the design.
- Define migration and rollback expectations for schema or storage changes.
- Avoid drifting into implementation-specific query or ORM code.

## Role Boundary

Data Design is not the full architecture or implementation plan. It explains
the data model, storage responsibilities, access patterns, integrity/security
constraints, and migration consequences that technical designs must honor.

## Completion Criteria
- The model is understandable to another engineer without reading code.
- Key data decisions and constraints are explicit.
- Access patterns and migration strategy are concrete enough to guide
  implementation and tests.</code></pre></details></td></tr>
