## Purpose

A Contract is the **normative interface artifact**. Its unique job is to define
the exact surface another team, service, test suite, CLI caller, or agent can
implement against without reading the implementation.

Contracts are not feature specs; they do not decide product scope. Contracts
are not architecture or solution designs; they do not explain why the interface
exists or how internals work. Contracts own exact fields, commands, payloads,
status codes, compatibility rules, examples, and error semantics.

# Contract

**Contract ID**: API-001
**Type**: HTTP API
**Version**: v1
**Status**: complete
**Related**: FEAT-001, US-001, ADR-001

## Purpose

This contract defines the HTTP API for creating a draft DepositMatch import
session by uploading one bank deposit CSV and one invoice export CSV for a
client.

## Scope and Boundaries

- In scope: creating one draft import session, accepting two CSV files,
  recording source file metadata, and returning the mapping-review location.
- Out of scope: column mapping, row validation, import confirmation, match
  generation, and accepted source-row storage.
- Owning system or team: DepositMatch API Service.

## Normative Surface

Use MUST, MUST NOT, MAY, and SHOULD intentionally. Every field, command,
message, endpoint, or payload element named here is part of the contract.

| Element | Type / Shape | Required | Rules | Notes |
|---------|--------------|----------|-------|-------|
| `POST /v1/clients/{clientId}/import-sessions` | HTTP operation | yes | MUST accept `multipart/form-data`; MUST authenticate the user; MUST authorize access to `clientId` | Creates a draft session only |
| `clientId` | UUID path parameter | yes | MUST identify a client visible to the authenticated firm user | 404 if not visible |
| `bankFile` | file part | yes | MUST have `.csv` extension; MUST be parsed as UTF-8 text; max 10 MB | Bank deposit export |
| `invoiceFile` | file part | yes | MUST have `.csv` extension; MUST be parsed as UTF-8 text; max 10 MB | Invoice export |
| `sourceType.bank` | enum | yes | MUST be `bank_csv` | Server-assigned in response |
| `sourceType.invoice` | enum | yes | MUST be `invoice_csv` | Server-assigned in response |
| Success response | JSON object | yes | MUST return HTTP 201 and include `importSessionId`, `clientId`, `status`, `files`, and `next.href` | `status` MUST be `draft` |
| `files[].fileId` | UUID | yes | MUST be stable for this uploaded file | Used by later mapping step |
| `files[].originalName` | string | yes | MUST preserve uploaded file name, excluding path | Do not include local client path |
| `files[].sizeBytes` | integer | yes | MUST be greater than 0 and no more than 10,485,760 | Per file |
| `next.href` | URL path | yes | MUST point to the mapping review endpoint for the created session | Relative path allowed |

## Precedence and Compatibility

- Versioning: breaking changes require a new `/v{n}` path.
- Ordering or precedence: server-side authorization and file-type validation
  precede file storage.
- Backward-compatibility rules: v1 clients may ignore unknown response fields.
  The API MUST NOT remove or rename v1 response fields without a new version.
- Deprecation rules: deprecated fields must remain for one paid-release cycle
  after replacement is documented.

## Error Semantics

Errors use `application/problem+json`.

| Condition | Error / Outcome | Retry | Recovery Expectation |
|-----------|------------------|-------|----------------------|
| User cannot access `clientId` | 404 `client-not-found` | no | Choose a client visible to the authenticated user. |
| Missing `bankFile` or `invoiceFile` | 400 `missing-import-file` | yes | Submit both file parts. |
| File is not CSV | 415 `unsupported-import-file-type` | yes | Replace the invalid file with a CSV. |
| File exceeds 10 MB | 413 `import-file-too-large` | yes | Export a smaller date range or split the file. |
| API cannot store the uploaded file | 503 `import-storage-unavailable` | yes | Retry after `Retry-After` if present. |

## Non-Normative Notes

This API creates only a draft import session. Mapping and validation are
separate contracts so clients can recover from upload problems before row-level
processing begins.

## Validation Checklist

- [ ] Normative fields and rules are explicit.
- [ ] Compatibility and precedence rules are explicit.
- [ ] Error handling is explicit.
- [ ] At least one executable test can be derived from this contract.
- [ ] Non-normative notes cannot be mistaken for contract requirements.

Document the normative interface or schema that another team can implement
against directly.

## Purpose

A Contract is the **normative interface artifact**. Its unique job is to define
the exact surface another team, service, test suite, CLI caller, or agent can
implement against without reading the implementation.

Contracts are not feature specs; they do not decide product scope. Contracts
are not architecture or solution designs; they do not explain why the interface
exists or how internals work. Contracts own exact fields, commands, payloads,
status codes, compatibility rules, examples, and error semantics.

## Reference Anchors

Use these local resource summaries as grounding:

- `docs/resources/openapi-specification.md` grounds exact API surface, schemas,
  responses, examples, and validation.
- `docs/resources/rfc-9457-problem-details.md` grounds structured HTTP error
  semantics and recovery guidance.

## Focus
- State the contract scope and boundaries clearly.
- Specify exact commands, fields, types, units, enums, ranges, and requiredness
  where relevant.
- Define precedence, ordering, compatibility, and versioning rules explicitly.
- Define failure modes, error codes, retry behavior, and recovery expectations.
- Include concrete examples and a validation checklist.
- Keep the document normative and implementation-independent; rationale belongs
  in ADRs and broader approach belongs in solution or technical designs.

## Boundary Test

| If you are writing... | Put it in... |
|---|---|
| User-visible behavior and requirements | Feature Specification |
| Structural rationale or technology choice | Architecture or ADR |
| Exact interface surface, schemas, commands, errors, and compatibility | Contract |
| Component internals or implementation approach | Solution/Technical Design |
| Test fixtures and automation strategy | Test Plan or Story Test Plan |

## Completion Criteria
- The contract is specific enough for an independent implementation.
- Normative surface details are explicit rather than implied.
- Error semantics and compatibility rules are documented.
- Tests can be derived directly from the contract.</code></pre></details></td></tr>
