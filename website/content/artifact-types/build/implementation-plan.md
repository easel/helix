## Purpose

The Implementation Plan is the **build sequencing and execution-readiness
artifact**. Its unique job is to translate approved story, technical design, and
test-plan context into bounded implementation slices with dependencies,
validation gates, and closeout evidence.

It is not the tracker. The runtime owns issue state and execution. This artifact
defines the intended build shape so DDx beads or another runtime can execute
without inventing scope, ordering, or validation rules.

# Build Plan

## Scope

Build the US-001 upload slice for DepositMatch CSV import. This plan covers
database migration, upload service, API route, UI upload flow, and story test
handoff. It does not cover column mapping, row validation, import confirmation,
or match generation.

**Governing Artifacts**:

- `example.user-story.depositmatch.upload-csv`
- `example.technical-design.depositmatch.upload-csv`
- `example.story-test-plan.depositmatch.upload-csv`
- `example.contract.depositmatch.import-session-api`
- `example.solution-design.depositmatch.csv-import`

## Shared Constraints

- API-001 is normative.
- Failing tests from STP-001 must exist before behavior implementation.
- Raw CSV row values must not appear in logs.
- Storage failure must not leave partial session metadata.
- Build slices should stay small enough for review and rollback.

## Implementation Slices

| Slice | Story / Area | Governing Artifacts | Depends On | Validation Gate | Notes |
|-------|---------------|---------------------|------------|-----------------|-------|
| B-001 | Database migration and repository | TD-001, STP-001 | None | `pnpm test -- importSessionRepository` | Establish persistence contract first |
| B-002 | Source-file storage adapter and upload service tests | TD-001, STP-001 | B-001 | `pnpm test -- importUploadService` | Add red tests before service implementation |
| B-003 | API route and contract tests | API-001, TD-001, STP-001 | B-001, B-002 | `pnpm test -- importSessions` | Proves success and problem-details errors |
| B-004 | React upload UI and component tests | US-001, TD-001, STP-001 | B-003 | `pnpm test -- ImportSessionUpload` | Uses API response `next.href` directly |
| B-005 | P0 E2E smoke and closeout | US-001, STP-001 | B-004 | `pnpm test:e2e -- upload-csv` | Final story evidence |

## Issue Decomposition

Story-level work is tracked via `ddx bead` in `.ddx/beads.jsonl`.

**Per-issue requirements**:

- Labels: `helix`, `activity:build`, `kind:build`, `story:US-001`
- References: US-001, TD-001, STP-001, API-001, this build plan
- `spec-id` pointing at the nearest governing artifact
- Blockers as dependency links

| Story / Area | Goal | Dependencies |
|--------------|------|--------------|
| US-001 / persistence | Create draft session and file metadata persistence | None |
| US-001 / upload service | Store encrypted originals and persist metadata transactionally | persistence |
| US-001 / API | Expose API-001 success and error behavior | upload service |
| US-001 / UI | Let Maya upload files and route to mapping review | API |
| US-001 / E2E | Prove happy path and rejection path in browser | UI |

## Validation Plan

- [ ] Failing tests exist before implementation starts for each slice.
- [ ] B-001 passes repository tests.
- [ ] B-002 passes upload service tests and log-redaction assertions.
- [ ] B-003 passes API-001 contract tests.
- [ ] B-004 passes UI component tests.
- [ ] B-005 passes Playwright upload smoke test.
- [ ] `pnpm test`, `pnpm test:coverage`, and `pnpm test:e2e -- upload-csv`
  pass before closing the story.

## Risks and Rollbacks

| Risk | Impact | Response | Rollback |
|------|--------|----------|----------|
| Multipart upload implementation buffers files in memory | H | Add memory regression test and stream files to storage | Revert B-002/B-003 before UI slice lands |
| API/UI validation drift | M | API contract tests remain authoritative; UI validation stays advisory | Disable `csvImportV1` UI entry point |
| Storage failure leaves partial data | H | Wrap metadata commit after storage success; test failure injection | Revert service slice and drop draft sessions created in test only |

## Exit Criteria

- [ ] Build issue set is defined with sequence and dependencies.
- [ ] Shared constraints are documented.
- [ ] Verification expectations are explicit.
- [ ] Runtime issues can be created from this plan without inventing scope.

## Review Checklist

- [ ] Governing artifacts are listed and exist on disk
- [ ] Shared constraints trace back to requirements, design, or architecture
- [ ] Build sequence has a justified ordering
- [ ] Dependencies between build steps are explicit
- [ ] Each story/area references its governing artifacts
- [ ] Issue decomposition follows tracker conventions
- [ ] Quality gates are specific and enforceable
- [ ] Risks have concrete responses
- [ ] Plan is consistent with governing test plan and technical designs

Create the canonical build plan for the Build activity. Keep it short, but preserve the sequencing, issue boundaries, and verification rules needed to execute implementation against the test plan and technical designs.

## Purpose

The Implementation Plan is the **build sequencing and execution-readiness
artifact**. Its unique job is to translate approved story, technical design, and
test-plan context into bounded implementation slices with dependencies,
validation gates, and closeout evidence.

It is not the tracker. The runtime owns issue state and execution. This artifact
defines the intended build shape so DDx beads or another runtime can execute
without inventing scope, ordering, or validation rules.

## Reference Anchors

Use this local resource summary as grounding:

- `docs/resources/google-small-cls.md` grounds small, reviewable,
  rollback-friendly implementation slices with related tests.

## Storage Location

`docs/helix/04-build/implementation-plan.md`

## Required Inputs

- `docs/helix/03-test/test-plan.md` and `docs/helix/03-test/test-plans/TP-*.md`
- `docs/helix/02-design/technical-designs/TD-*.md`
- project-level design constraints

## Include

- scope and governing artifacts
- build order and dependencies
- issue decomposition rules
- quality gates and closeout criteria
- risks that should refine upstream artifacts

## Boundary Test

| If you are writing... | Put it in... |
|---|---|
| Product or feature behavior changes | PRD / Feature Specification / User Story |
| Design or interface decisions | Solution Design / Technical Design / Contract / ADR |
| Exact story tests and fixtures | Story Test Plan |
| Build slice order, dependencies, and validation gates | Implementation Plan |
| Assignee, live status, claim, execution logs | DDx bead or runtime issue |

- [ ] Dependencies between build steps are explicit
- [ ] Each story/area references its governing artifacts (TP, TD)

- [ ] Quality gates are specific and enforceable, not aspirational
- [ ] Risks have concrete responses (&quot;we do X&quot;), not vague strategies
- [ ] Plan is consistent with governing test plan and technical designs</code></pre></details></td></tr>
