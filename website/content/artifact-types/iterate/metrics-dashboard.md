## Purpose

Metrics Dashboard is the **iteration-level measurement summary**. Its unique
job is to compare current metric values against explicit baselines, interpret
direction and tolerance, and produce a clear decision about improvement,
regression, or noise.

It consumes Metric Definitions. It does not redefine metric formulas, command
semantics, or labels. It informs the Improvement Backlog but does not decide
implementation work by itself.

# Metrics Dashboard: DepositMatch CSV Import Pilot Readiness

**Review Window**: 2026-05-05 - 2026-05-12
**Baseline**: FEAT-001 pre-release benchmark floor from 2026-05-05
**Status**: complete

## Decision

The latest change improved CSV import validation time and remains within the
FEAT-001 performance target. No performance backlog item is required for this
metric. Continue monitoring during pilot rollout.

## Summary

The representative 10,000-row CSV import validation benchmark improved from
5.8 seconds to 4.4 seconds. The current value is below the 5-second target and
outside the 5% noise band, so the result counts as a meaningful improvement.

## Metrics Table

| Metric | Baseline | Current | Direction | Result | Source |
|--------|----------|---------|-----------|--------|--------|
| `csv-import-validation-seconds` | 5.8 seconds | 4.4 seconds | lower | pass / improved | `docs/helix/06-iterate/metrics/csv-import-validation-seconds.yaml`; `pnpm metric:csv-import-validation -- --fixture fixtures/import/acme-10000-rows` |

## Interpretation Rules

- Values within 5% of baseline are treated as noise.
- Values above 5 seconds violate the FEAT-001 performance target and create an
  improvement backlog candidate.
- Values below target but worse than baseline by more than 5% create a watch
  item, not an automatic build task.

## Trend Notes

- Validation improved after switching row checks to batched normalization before
  persistence.
- No corresponding increase in upload API 5xx rate was observed in staging.
- Pilot rollout should still watch p95 upload response time because production
  file sizes may differ from fixture data.

## Follow-Up

- No immediate improvement issue.
- Continue pilot monitoring through the deployment checklist signals.
- Re-run the benchmark after adding column mapping and row-level validation
  stories.

## Review Checklist

- [x] Baseline is explicit
- [x] Each metric cites a source
- [x] The summary states the decision implication

Document the iteration-level metrics summary used to judge whether the latest
changeset improved the system.

## Purpose

Metrics Dashboard is the **iteration-level measurement summary**. Its unique
job is to compare current metric values against explicit baselines, interpret
direction and tolerance, and produce a clear decision about improvement,
regression, or noise.

It consumes Metric Definitions. It does not redefine metric formulas, command
semantics, or labels. It informs the Improvement Backlog but does not decide
implementation work by itself.

## Reference Anchors

Use this local resource summary as grounding:

- `docs/resources/google-sre-monitoring-distributed-systems.md` grounds
  dashboard summaries as interpreted quantitative signals with clear sources.

## Focus
- Start from the canonical metric definitions in `docs/helix/06-iterate/metrics/`.
- Compare the current measurement against the previous baseline or committed floor.
- State whether the change improved, regressed, or stayed within noise.
- Include only the metrics needed to support the decision.
- Cite the source of each metric and the measurement command or report.
- Keep raw observability setup and implementation details out of this artifact.

## Boundary Test

| If you are writing... | Put it in... |
|---|---|
| Metric unit, command, tolerance, and labels | Metric Definition |
| Current-vs-baseline interpretation for one iteration | Metrics Dashboard |
| Prioritized follow-up work | Improvement Backlog |
| Alerting or dashboard implementation details | Monitoring Setup |

## Completion Criteria
- Every metric cited has a source definition and current value.
- The comparison baseline is explicit.
- The conclusion is actionable and easy to hand to the next iteration.</code></pre></details></td></tr>
