# Security Metrics - Pilot Iteration 1

## Incident Response

| Metric | Current | Target | Trend |
|--------|---------|--------|-------|
| Mean Time to Detect (MTTD) | baseline: 4 minutes for synthetic telemetry alert | under 5 minutes | baseline set |
| Mean Time to Respond (MTTR) | baseline: 18 minutes for synthetic import outage | under 30 minutes | baseline set |
| Incidents resolved within SLA | 1 of 1 synthetic incidents | 100% | baseline set |
| False-positive alert rate | 1 of 6 security alerts | under 20% | baseline set |

**Incident Summary**

- Total incidents this period: 1 synthetic restricted-telemetry drill.
- Critical (required immediate response): 0 production incidents.
- Fully resolved: 1 drill resolved through runbook.

**Root Causes** (critical and high only)

| Root Cause | Count | Mitigation Status |
|------------|-------|-------------------|
| none | 0 | no critical/high production incident this period |

## Vulnerability Management

| Metric | Current | Target | Trend |
|--------|---------|--------|-------|
| Open critical vulnerabilities | 0 | 0 | baseline set |
| Open high vulnerabilities | 1 development dependency | 0 before pilot go-live | baseline set |
| MTTR for critical vulns | not applicable | under 2 business days | baseline set |
| Patch compliance rate | 94% direct dependencies current | 95% before pilot go-live | baseline set |

## Application Security

| Metric | Current | Target | Trend |
|--------|---------|--------|-------|
| SAST findings (new this period) | 2 medium findings, both in non-production code paths | 0 high/critical, medium triaged within 5 days | baseline set |
| DAST findings (new this period) | not run; staging environment not stable | run before pilot go-live | baseline set |
| Dependency vulnerabilities (direct) | 1 high, 0 critical | 0 high/critical before pilot go-live | baseline set |
| Security review coverage | 5 of 5 high-risk controls mapped to tests | 100% high-risk controls | baseline set |

## Compliance Status

| Requirement | Status | Open Gaps | Target Resolution |
|-------------|--------|-----------|-------------------|
| FTC Safeguards applicability review | pending counsel | confirm pilot-data obligations | before live customer data |
| Restricted telemetry policy | implemented in tests, not production-proven | production log scan needs first live run | first pilot day |
| Support access auditability | implemented in tests | support grant review cadence not exercised | first weekly operations review |
| Source CSV retention | designed, not verified in production | retention job dry run needed | before second pilot customer |

## Security Posture Trend

- **Overall risk level**: Medium - Trend: baseline set.
- **Summary**: Security controls are test-mapped, but go-live remains blocked
  by one high dependency vulnerability, pending counsel review, and unproven
  production log scanning.

## Recommendations

Each recommendation must be specific enough to create a tracker issue.

| Recommendation | Priority | Rationale | Expected Impact |
|----------------|----------|-----------|-----------------|
| Upgrade or replace the high-risk direct dependency before pilot go-live | High | Direct high vulnerability violates go-live target | Removes release blocker |
| Run DAST against stable staging once deployment checklist passes | High | DAST has no baseline yet | Establishes API/browser attack-surface baseline |
| Exercise source CSV retention job with pilot fixtures | Medium | Retention control is designed but not production-verified | Reduces data-retention uncertainty |
| Add weekly support grant review to routine operations evidence | Medium | Support access control is test-covered but not operationally exercised | Improves support-access audit confidence |

Create a security metrics report for one iteration.

## Required Inputs
- Security monitoring and incident data for the iteration period
- Vulnerability scan results (SAST, DAST, dependency scans)
- Compliance audit findings, if applicable
- Previous security metrics report for trend comparison

## Reference Anchors

Use these local resource summaries as grounding:

- `docs/resources/nist-cybersecurity-measurement-guidance.md` grounds
  risk-based, trend-oriented security measurement.
- `docs/resources/owasp-asvs.md` grounds application-security control coverage.
- `docs/resources/google-sre-incident-management-guide.md` grounds incident
  response measurement and follow-up.

## Produced Output
- `docs/helix/06-iterate/security-metrics.md`

## Focus

Report on security posture across four areas: incident response, vulnerability
management, application security, and compliance. For each area, state the
current value, the target, and the trend. Do not repeat raw data in prose —
summarize what the numbers mean and what action they justify.
Separate production security metrics from product outcome metrics unless the
security signal directly changes operational risk.

Trend comparison against the previous period is required. If no prior report
exists, note the baseline and set targets for the next iteration.

Every recommendation must be specific enough to become a tracker issue. Vague
recommendations (&quot;improve security posture&quot;) are not acceptable.

## Completion Criteria
- [ ] All four metric areas populated with current data
- [ ] Trend column populated for each metric (or baseline set if first report)
- [ ] At least one recommendation per area that is actionable as a tracker issue
- [ ] Root cause included for any critical or high-severity incidents
- [ ] Report covers the same iteration period as `metrics-dashboard.md`
- [ ] Raw scanner or incident output is summarized, not pasted wholesale
