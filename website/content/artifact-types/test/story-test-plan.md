## Purpose

Story Test Plan is the **story-level executable verification handoff**. Its
unique job is to turn one user story's acceptance criteria and technical design
into concrete failing tests, fixtures, commands, and setup before Build starts.

It inherits the project Test Plan. It does not redefine test strategy, coverage
targets, or feature-wide risk. It owns the exact evidence needed for one story
slice.

# Story Test Plan: TP-001-upload-csv-files

## Story Reference

**User Story**: [[US-001-upload-csv-files]]
**Technical Design**: [[TD-001-upload-csv-files]]
**Related Solution Design**: [[SD-001-csv-import-column-mapping]]
**Project Test Plan**: [[test-plan]]

## Scope and Objective

**Goal**: Prove that a reviewer can upload one bank CSV and one invoice CSV for
a selected client, create a draft import session, reject invalid file types, and
record source file metadata.
**Blocking Gate**: `pnpm test -- importSessions && pnpm test:e2e -- upload-csv`

**In Scope**

- API-001 success response for a valid two-file upload.
- Problem-details error for non-CSV file upload.
- Draft import-session and import-file metadata persistence.
- React upload flow routing to mapping review after success.

**Out of Scope**

- Column mapping.
- Row-level validation.
- Import confirmation.
- Match suggestion generation.
- Cleanup of abandoned draft sessions.

## Acceptance Criteria Test Mapping

| Acceptance Criterion | Failing Test(s) to Create or Run | Test Level | File or Command | Setup / Data | Notes |
|----------------------|----------------------------------|------------|-----------------|--------------|-------|
| Given Maya is viewing Acme Dental, when she uploads one valid bank CSV and one valid invoice CSV, then DepositMatch creates one draft import session for Acme Dental and opens mapping review. | `creates_draft_import_session_for_two_csv_files`, `routes_to_mapping_review_after_success` | Contract, Integration, E2E | `apps/api/test/routes/importSessions.test.ts`; `apps/web/src/features/import/ImportSessionUpload.test.tsx`; `pnpm test:e2e -- upload-csv` | `fixtures/acme-bank-2026-05-08.csv`, `fixtures/acme-invoices-2026-05-08.csv`, authenticated Maya user, Acme Dental client | Covers API and visible reviewer flow |
| Given Maya is viewing Acme Dental, when she uploads a PDF instead of a CSV for either required file, then DepositMatch rejects the file before parsing and keeps the import session in draft. | `rejects_non_csv_bank_file`, `renders_problem_details_for_invalid_file_type` | Contract, UI | `apps/api/test/routes/importSessions.test.ts`; `apps/web/src/features/import/ImportSessionUpload.test.tsx` | `fixtures/statement.pdf`, valid invoice CSV | Asserts 415 `unsupported-import-file-type` |
| Given Maya has uploaded both required CSV files, when the files are accepted, then the import session records the client, file names, upload time, and source type for each file. | `persists_import_file_metadata`, `does_not_log_raw_csv_rows` | Integration, Security | `apps/api/test/services/importUploadService.test.ts`; `pnpm test -- importUploadService` | S3 fake, PostgreSQL test DB, log capture | Verifies metadata and financial-data logging concern |

## Executable Proof

### Primary Commands

```bash
pnpm test -- importSessions
pnpm test -- importUploadService
pnpm test -- ImportSessionUpload
pnpm test:e2e -- upload-csv
```

### Planned Test Files

- `apps/api/test/routes/importSessions.test.ts`
- `apps/api/test/services/importUploadService.test.ts`
- `apps/web/src/features/import/ImportSessionUpload.test.tsx`
- `apps/web/e2e/upload-csv.spec.ts`

### Coverage Focus

- P0: valid two-file upload, non-CSV rejection, metadata persistence, no raw
  financial row logging.
- P1: UI advisory validation for missing second file.

## Data and Setup

| Need | Required For | Source / Strategy |
|------|--------------|-------------------|
| Authenticated Maya user | API, UI, E2E | Test user factory with Acme Dental access |
| Acme Dental client | API, UI, E2E | Client factory seeded before each test |
| Valid bank CSV | Happy path | `fixtures/acme-bank-2026-05-08.csv` |
| Valid invoice CSV | Happy path | `fixtures/acme-invoices-2026-05-08.csv` |
| Invalid PDF | Error path | `fixtures/statement.pdf` |
| S3-compatible fake | Integration | Test storage adapter with failure injection |
| Log capture | Security assertion | Test logger sink scanned for raw CSV values |

## Edge Cases and Failure Modes

- Non-CSV bank file returns 415 and does not create a committed import session.
- Missing invoice file keeps the UI in draft state and does not call mapping
  review.
- Storage failure returns 503 and does not commit session metadata.
- Uploaded filenames are stored without local path components.

## Build Handoff

**Implementation Order**

1. Create API contract tests for success, missing file, non-CSV, and storage
   failure responses.
2. Create repository/service integration tests for draft-session and file
   metadata persistence.
3. Create UI component tests for successful routing and problem-details errors.
4. Create the Playwright happy-path smoke test after API/UI tests are green.

**Constraints**

- API-001 is normative.
- Raw CSV row values must not appear in application logs.
- S3 storage failure must not leave partial database state.

**Done When**

- [ ] Every in-scope acceptance criterion has passing evidence.
- [ ] Named commands and test files exist and run.
- [ ] Out-of-scope mapping and row-validation coverage remains deferred to
  later story test plans.
- [ ] The story can fail red before implementation and pass green after
  implementation.

## Review Checklist

- [ ] References the governing story and technical design
- [ ] Every active acceptance criterion maps to concrete failing tests
- [ ] File paths, commands, or test identifiers are specific enough to execute
- [ ] Setup, fixtures, mocks, and seed data are explicit
- [ ] Edge cases cover real story risks rather than generic boilerplate
- [ ] Scope remains bounded to one story slice
- [ ] Build handoff gives implementation a usable sequence

Create the canonical story-scoped test plan for one bounded story slice. This
artifact exists because the project-wide `test-plan.md` does not replace the
need for per-story acceptance-to-test traceability.

## Purpose

Story Test Plan is the **story-level executable verification handoff**. Its
unique job is to turn one user story&#x27;s acceptance criteria and technical design
into concrete failing tests, fixtures, commands, and setup before Build starts.

It inherits the project Test Plan. It does not redefine test strategy, coverage
targets, or feature-wide risk. It owns the exact evidence needed for one story
slice.

## Reference Anchors

Use these local resource summaries as grounding:

- `docs/resources/cucumber-executable-specifications.md` grounds acceptance
  criteria as observable executable examples.
- `docs/resources/google-test-sizes.md` grounds story test levels by scope,
  dependency, and execution cost.

## Storage Location

`docs/helix/03-test/test-plans/TP-{id}-{name}.md`

## What to Include

- the governing `[[US-XXX-*]]` and `[[TD-XXX-*]]` references
- a tight scope statement plus explicit out-of-scope boundaries
- a matrix mapping each active acceptance criterion to concrete failing tests
- executable proof details: test file paths, commands, or named test cases
- setup, fixtures, seed data, mocks, and environment assumptions
- edge cases and error scenarios that the story must prove before build begins
- build handoff notes that help implementation sequence the work

## Minimum Quality Bar

- Stay story-scoped. Do not drift into feature-wide strategy or generic testing doctrine.
- Name runnable evidence, not just test categories.
- Prefer one compact mapping table over repeated prose.
- If an acceptance criterion is not being covered now, say why explicitly.

## Boundary Test

| If you are writing... | Put it in... |
|---|---|
| Project-wide test levels, coverage, and CI gates | Test Plan |
| One story&#x27;s concrete tests, fixtures, commands, and setup | Story Test Plan |
| Product behavior or acceptance criteria | User Story / Feature Specification |
| Implementation file changes | Technical Design / Implementation Plan |

# Story Test Plan: TP-XXX-[story-name]

## Story Reference

**User Story**: [[US-XXX-[story-name]]]
**Technical Design**: [[TD-XXX-[story-name]]]
**Related Solution Design**: [[SD-XXX-[feature-name]]] or N/A
**Project Test Plan**: [[test-plan]]

## Scope and Objective

**Goal**: [What this story must prove before build starts]
**Blocking Gate**: [Command or suite that must pass for this story]

**In Scope**
- [Bounded behavior this TP governs]

**Out of Scope**
- [Adjacent behavior intentionally left to another TP, feature, or future slice]

## Acceptance Criteria Test Mapping

| Acceptance Criterion | Failing Test(s) to Create or Run | Test Level | File or Command | Setup / Data | Notes |
|----------------------|----------------------------------|------------|-----------------|--------------|-------|
| [Given/When/Then criterion] | `[test_name]` | Unit / Integration / Contract / E2E | `tests/...` or `bash ...` | [Fixture, seed, mock] | [Edge case or sequencing note] |

## Executable Proof

### Primary Commands

```bash
[command that proves this TP]
```

### Planned Test Files

- `tests/...`
- `tests/...`

### Coverage Focus

- P0: [Must-pass behavior]
- P1: [Important secondary behavior]

## Data and Setup

| Need | Required For | Source / Strategy |
|------|--------------|-------------------|
| [Fixture / seed / mock / env var] | [Tests] | [Where it comes from] |

## Edge Cases and Failure Modes

- [Boundary value or empty-state handling]
- [Validation failure or invalid input]
- [Dependency failure, timeout, or permission edge]

## Build Handoff

**Implementation Order**
1. [What should be implemented first to turn the first red test green]
2. [What follows once the core path passes]

**Constraints**
- [Constraint inherited from requirements, design, concern, or contract]

**Done When**
- [ ] Every in-scope acceptance criterion has passing evidence
- [ ] Named commands or test files exist and run
- [ ] Out-of-scope coverage remains explicitly deferred rather than silently skipped
- [ ] The story can fail red before implementation and pass green after implementation

## Review Checklist

- [ ] References the governing story and technical design
- [ ] Every active acceptance criterion maps to concrete failing tests
- [ ] File paths, commands, or test identifiers are specific enough to execute
- [ ] Setup, fixtures, mocks, and seed data are explicit
- [ ] Edge cases cover real story risks rather than generic boilerplate
- [ ] Scope remains bounded to one story slice
- [ ] Build handoff gives implementation a usable sequence</code></pre></details></td></tr>
