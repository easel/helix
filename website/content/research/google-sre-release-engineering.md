# Google SRE: Release Engineering

## Source

- Accessed: 2026-05-12

## Summary

Google's Site Reliability Engineering book describes release engineering as the
discipline of building, packaging, testing, deploying, and controlling releases
reliably. The chapter emphasizes repeatability, automation, hermetic builds,
staged rollout, clear ownership, and the ability to roll back or stop a bad
release quickly.

## Relevant Findings

- Deployment readiness should depend on reproducible build and test evidence,
  not informal confidence.
- Staged rollout and verification reduce the blast radius of bad releases.
- Rollback or release abort paths must be known before the release starts.
- Release ownership and auditable decisions matter during high-pressure
  deployment windows.

## HELIX Usage

This resource informs the Deployment Checklist artifact. HELIX uses it to keep
deployment readiness concise, evidence-based, staged, and rollback-aware.

## Authority Boundary

This resource supports deployment discipline. It does not replace project
runbooks, monitoring setup, implementation plans, or release notes.
