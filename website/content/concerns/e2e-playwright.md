## Description

## Category
testing

## Areas
ui, site

## Components

- **Test runner**: Playwright (`@playwright/test`)
- **Browser engines**: Chromium (default), optionally Firefox and WebKit
- **Screenshot snapshots**: Visual regression detection via `toHaveScreenshot()`
- **Video recording**: Full test execution videos for human review
- **Demo reel**: A dedicated slow-paced Playwright script that produces a
  polished walkthrough video of the application for stakeholder review,
  README embedding, or onboarding
- **Trace files**: Playwright traces for debugging failures
- **Test data**: Fake/seed data that exercises every meaningful UI state

## Constraints

- Tests run in real browsers, not jsdom or happy-dom — no simulated DOM
- Every navigable page must have at least one test that loads it and verifies
  key content
- Every user-facing workflow must have at least one test that exercises it
  end-to-end
- Test data must be realistic and comprehensive — seed the application with
  fake data that covers all UI states (empty, populated, error, edge cases)
- Tests must produce visible output:
  - Console logs showing what each test is doing (use `test.step()`)
  - Screenshots on failure (Playwright default)
  - Full-page screenshots for visual regression
  - Video recordings of every test for human review
- Screenshot baselines are committed to the repo and reviewed in PRs
- Tests must be runnable locally and in CI with identical results
- Playwright version pinned in `package.json`

## Test Data Requirements

The application under test must have a data seeding mechanism:

- **Static sites** (Hugo): content files ARE the test data — ensure content
  covers all page types, shortcodes, navigation patterns, and edge cases
  (empty sections, long titles, deep nesting)
- **Web apps**: seed script or fixture that populates the database/API with
  realistic fake data before tests run. The seed must be deterministic
  (same data every run)
- **Never test against an empty state** — an empty app tells you nothing
  about whether the UI works

## Configuration Pattern

```typescript
import { defineConfig } from '@playwright/test'

export default defineConfig({
  testDir: './e2e',
  timeout: 30000,

  // Video and trace for every test
  use: {
    baseURL: 'http://127.0.0.1:<port>',
    headless: true,
    video: 'on',
    trace: 'retain-on-failure',
    screenshot: 'on',
  },

  // Reporter with step-level detail
  reporter: [
    ['list'],
    ['html', { open: 'never' }],
  ],

  // Dev server
  webServer: {
    command: '<start command>',
    port: '<port>',
    reuseExistingServer: true,
    timeout: 15000,
  },
})
```

## Test Structure Pattern

```typescript
import { test, expect } from '@playwright/test'

test.describe('Feature Area', () => {
  test('page loads with expected content', async ({ page }) => {
    await test.step('navigate to page', async () => {
      await page.goto('/path')
    })

    await test.step('verify hero content', async () => {
      await expect(page.getByRole('heading', { name: 'Title' })).toBeVisible()
    })

    await test.step('capture screenshot', async () => {
      await expect(page).toHaveScreenshot('page-name.png', { fullPage: true })
    })
  })

  test('workflow: user completes action', async ({ page }) => {
    await test.step('start at entry point', async () => {
      await page.goto('/')
    })

    await test.step('click through workflow', async () => {
      await page.getByRole('link', { name: 'Get Started' }).click()
      await expect(page).toHaveURL(/getting-started/)
    })

    await test.step('verify end state', async () => {
      await expect(page.getByText('expected content')).toBeVisible()
    })
  })
})
```

Use `test.step()` for every meaningful action — this produces structured
logs that show exactly what each test is doing.

## Video and Artifact Output

Playwright generates:
- `test-results/` — videos, screenshots, traces per test
- `playwright-report/` — HTML report with embedded videos

Both directories should be gitignored. In CI, upload as artifacts.

## Demo Reel

Every project with a web UI should include a Playwright demo reel script that
produces a polished walkthrough video. This replaces manual screen recordings
with a reproducible, scriptable demo.

### Demo reel structure

The demo reel is a single Playwright test file (e.g., `e2e/demo.spec.ts`) that:

1. Seeds the application with comprehensive, realistic data
2. Navigates every major page and workflow at a human-readable pace
3. Uses `page.waitForTimeout()` between actions for viewing comfort
4. Produces a `.webm` video in `test-results/` that can be converted to
   `.mp4` or `.gif` for embedding

### Demo reel conventions

- File: `e2e/demo.spec.ts` (separate from test specs)
- Viewport: 1280x720 (HD, suitable for embedding)
- Pacing: 1-2 second pauses between navigations, 2-3 seconds on key screens
- Use `test.step()` for structured logging of what each section shows
- Narrative structure: Overview (dashboard) -> Primary workflows -> Detail views
- Run with: `npx playwright test e2e/demo.spec.ts`
- Output: `test-results/demo-*/video.webm`
- The demo must run against seeded data — never against an empty state
- Re-record the demo after major UI changes

### Converting output

```bash
# WebM to MP4 (for README/docs)
ffmpeg -i test-results/demo-*/video.webm -c:v libx264 -preset slow -crf 22 demo.mp4

# WebM to GIF (for README, keep under 10MB)
ffmpeg -i test-results/demo-*/video.webm -vf "fps=10,scale=960:-1" -loop 0 demo.gif
```

## When to use

Any project with a web UI that users interact with. This includes:
- Documentation sites (Hugo/Hextra microsites)
- Web applications
- Admin dashboards
- Any HTML output that needs visual consistency

## Practices by phase

Agents working in any of these phases inherit the practices below via the bead's context digest.

## Requirements (Frame phase)
- Identify all user-facing pages and workflows that need testing
- Define what "test data" means for this project — what states must the UI show?
- Determine visual regression strategy: which pages get screenshot baselines?
- Decide on browser matrix: Chromium only, or cross-browser?

## Design
- Tests live in `<project-root>/e2e/` or `website/e2e/` for microsites
- One test file per feature area or page group
- Use `test.describe()` blocks to group related tests
- Use `test.step()` for every meaningful action — produces structured logs
- Test data is deterministic and committed (or seeded deterministically)
- Screenshot baselines committed under `e2e/*.spec.ts-snapshots/`
- Video recording enabled for all tests — `video: 'on'` in config

## Implementation
- Install: `npm install -D @playwright/test && npx playwright install`
- Configure `playwright.config.ts` with video, trace, and reporter settings
- Write tests that use real browser interactions (click, type, navigate)
- Use Playwright's locator API: `getByRole()`, `getByText()`, `getByLabel()`
- Prefer semantic selectors over CSS selectors or test-ids
- Every test should:
  1. Navigate to the page
  2. Verify key content is visible
  3. Capture a full-page screenshot for visual regression
- Workflow tests should:
  1. Start at the entry point
  2. Perform the user's action sequence
  3. Verify the end state
  4. Capture screenshots at key steps

## Test Data
- **Static sites**: ensure content files cover all page types, shortcodes,
  navigation levels, and edge cases. Add a "kitchen sink" test page if needed
  that exercises every component
- **Web apps**: create a seed script (e.g., `scripts/seed-test-data.sh`) that
  populates deterministic fake data. Run before tests. Include:
  - Empty states (zero items)
  - Populated states (10+ items)
  - Error states (invalid data, missing fields)
  - Edge cases (long text, special characters, large numbers)
- **Never test against production data** — always use controlled test data

## Testing
- Run locally: `npx playwright test` (starts dev server automatically)
- Update screenshots: `npx playwright test --update-snapshots`
- Review screenshots in PR diffs — screenshot changes must be intentional
- Run in CI: same command, upload `test-results/` and `playwright-report/`
  as artifacts
- After dependency updates (Playwright, browser, framework), re-baseline
  screenshots and review

## Video Review
- Videos are generated in `test-results/<test-name>/video.webm`
- Review videos when:
  - A test fails and the error message isn't clear
  - Updating screenshot baselines (watch the video to verify visual changes)
  - Debugging flaky tests (video shows timing/race conditions)
- In CI, upload `test-results/` as a build artifact for post-hoc review

## Demo Reel
- Create `e2e/demo.spec.ts` — a single test that walks through the entire app
- Seed with realistic data that makes the demo compelling (populated states,
  not empty states)
- Set viewport to 1280x720 for clean video output
- Pace with `page.waitForTimeout()`: 1-2s between clicks, 2-3s on key screens
- Use `test.step()` to narrate each section in the test output
- Structure: Dashboard overview -> key workflows -> detail pages -> settings
- Run separately: `npx playwright test e2e/demo.spec.ts`
- Output video lives in `test-results/` — convert to `.mp4` for embedding
- Re-record after significant UI changes
- The demo is documentation — keep it passing, keep it current

## Quality Gates
- `npx playwright test` passes with zero failures
- All screenshot baselines are committed and up-to-date
- Every navigable page has at least one test
- Every user-facing workflow has at least one end-to-end test
- Video recording is enabled (not disabled for speed)
- Demo reel script exists and produces a watchable video
- No tests skip or are marked `.only`

## CI Integration
- Run Playwright tests after the build step
- Upload `test-results/` and `playwright-report/` as artifacts
- Fail the build on any test failure
- Cache Playwright browsers to speed up CI
- For static sites: build first (`hugo --gc --minify`), then serve and test
