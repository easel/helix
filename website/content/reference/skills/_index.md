HELIX's durable skill surface is one alignment-and-planning skill. It packages
the methodology, artifact catalog, and authority-order rules so an AI runtime
can inspect project artifacts, identify drift, and propose the next safe plan.

The skill is not a queue runner, tracker, commit tool, or implementation loop.
Those capabilities belong to the runtime that embeds HELIX.

## Core skill contract

### Purpose

The alignment-and-planning skill reconciles a project's governing artifacts. It
starts from an explicit scope or operator question, reads the relevant Markdown
artifact set, compares artifacts by authority order, and returns an actionable
plan for restoring coherence.

Use it to answer questions such as:

- Which upstream artifact authorizes or blocks a proposed change?
- Which PRDs, feature specs, designs, tests, or deployment notes are stale?
- Which contradictions need a human decision before implementation?
- Which artifacts should be created, amended, or retired next?
- Which work items are safe for a runtime to execute after planning completes?

### Inputs

The skill expects access to:

- A scope, question, repository path, artifact path, or work-item reference.
- The HELIX artifact-type catalog from `workflows/activities/*/artifacts/`.
- The project's concrete governing artifacts, commonly under `docs/helix/`.
- Any project tracker metadata that links work items to specs, parents, or
  context digests.
- Runtime constraints, such as whether file writes are allowed or whether the
  operator only wants a read-only plan.

### Outputs

The skill produces:

- A concise alignment finding for the requested scope.
- The authority chain used to evaluate the scope.
- Drift, gaps, stale artifacts, and contradictions, grouped by impact.
- Open questions that require human authority rather than model inference.
- A plan for artifact edits, new work items, or runtime execution handoff.
- Optional Markdown edits when the operator explicitly authorizes writes.

### Authority order

HELIX planning is authority-ordered. Higher-level intent governs lower-level
documents and implementation plans. When artifacts conflict, the skill should
prefer the highest applicable authority and treat lower-level disagreement as
drift to reconcile.

The expected order is:

1. Product vision and principles.
2. PRDs and requirements.
3. Feature specs and user stories.
4. Designs and implementation plans.
5. Tests, examples, deployment notes, and operational records.
6. Code and generated outputs.

If the repository defines a more specific authority order, the skill should use
that project-local rule and report that it did so.

### Open-question behavior

The skill must not invent product decisions to close gaps. When authority is
missing, ambiguous, or contradictory, it should stop at a planning boundary and
surface the question explicitly.

Good open questions name:

- The conflicting or missing artifacts.
- The decision only a human or upstream artifact can make.
- The downstream work that should wait for the answer.
- The smallest artifact update that would unblock execution.

### Runtime expectations

A runtime embedding the skill should provide only a small capability set:

- Read Markdown and repository files.
- Search for artifact references and linked work items.
- Present findings and plans to an operator.
- Write Markdown only after approval or according to the runtime's governance
  rules.
- Hand execution-ready work to the runtime's own queue, tracker, or agent loop.

The runtime remains responsible for claims, locks, background workers, commits,
pull requests, CI, measurement, and deployment. HELIX supplies the planning
contract those actions should respect.

## Legacy mirrored skills

Older HELIX packages include `helix-*` skills that mirror CLI commands. They
are transitional compatibility surfaces for runtimes that still expose HELIX as
command-shaped operations. They are not the core methodology contract.

| Legacy skill | Runtime boundary |
|--------------|------------------|
| `helix-run` | Queue-drain supervision around a runtime loop |
| `helix-build` | One bounded runtime implementation pass |
| `helix-check` | Queue-health routing after ready work drains |
| `helix-frame` | Requirements drafting surface now covered by planning |
| `helix-design` | Design drafting surface now covered by planning |
| `helix-evolve` | Artifact-threading surface now covered by planning |
| `helix-review` | Post-implementation review surface |
| `helix-align` | Closest legacy name for the core alignment/planning skill |
| `helix-polish` | Runtime work-item refinement |
| `helix-triage` | Runtime work-item creation |
| `helix-next` | Runtime queue recommendation |
| `helix-experiment` | Runtime optimization loop |
| `helix-commit` | Runtime commit and gate workflow |
| `helix-worker` | Runtime background process management |
| `helix-backfill` | Recovery workflow for missing documentation |

Aliases such as `helix-implement` and `helix-plan` are also legacy
compatibility names. New public documentation and integrations should lead with
the alignment-and-planning contract, then describe any runtime-specific wrappers
as packaging details.

## Packaging shape

Current repository packages still use `skills/<name>/SKILL.md` files with YAML
front matter:

```yaml
---
name: helix-align
description: 'Run a HELIX alignment and planning review for a selected scope.'
argument-hint: "[scope]"
---
```

That file format is a packaging mechanism, not the methodology itself. A
Claude Code skill, Codex skill, DDx plugin, Databricks integration, or manual
operator guide should all wrap the same alignment-and-planning contract.
