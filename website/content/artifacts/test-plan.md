## What it is

The project-level test plan defines the testing strategy for the full
project: test levels and scope, framework choices, coverage targets,
critical paths, test data strategy, infrastructure requirements, and
sequencing. It drives failing tests before implementation begins and
provides traceability from requirements to test execution.

## Phase

**[Phase 3 — Test](/reference/glossary/phases/)** — Define how we know it works. Plans, suites, and procedures that bind specs to implementation.

# Test Plan Generation Prompt

Create the project-level test plan for the Test phase. Keep it concise, but include the minimum structure needed to drive failing tests before implementation.

## Storage Location

`docs/helix/03-test/test-plan.md`

## What to Include

- test levels and scope
- framework choices only where they matter
- coverage targets and critical paths
- test data strategy
- sequencing, dependencies, and infrastructure needs
- risks that can block test execution

## Keep In Mind

- tests are the executable specification
- every test should trace to a requirement or story
- do not add generic testing doctrine that the template already implies

Use template at `.ddx/plugins/helix/workflows/phases/03-test/artifacts/test-plan/template.md`.

# Test Plan

## Testing Strategy

**Goals**: [Primary objective] | [Quality gates]
**Out of Scope**: [Excluded areas]

### Test Levels

| Level | Coverage Target | Priority |
|-------|-----------------|----------|
| Contract | [Target] | P0/P1 |
| Integration | [Target] | P0/P1 |
| Unit | [Target] | P0/P1 |
| E2E | [Target] | P0/P1 |

### Frameworks

| Type | Framework | Reason |
|------|-----------|--------|
| Contract | [Framework] | [Why] |
| Integration | [Framework] | [Why] |
| Unit | [Framework] | [Why] |
| E2E | [Framework] | [Why] |

## Test Data

| Type | Strategy |
|------|----------|
| Fixtures | [Static data approach] |
| Factories | [Dynamic generation] |
| Mocks | [External service mocking] |

## Coverage Requirements

| Metric | Target | Minimum | Enforcement |
|--------|--------|---------|-------------|
| Line | 80% | 70% | CI blocks |
| Critical | 100% | 100% | Required |

### Critical Paths (P0)

1. [Auth flow]
2. [Core transaction]
3. [Data persistence]
4. [Error handling]

### Secondary Paths (P1-P2)

- P1: [Secondary features] | P2: [Edge cases, rare scenarios]

## Implementation Order
1. [What must be written first and why]
2. [What follows]
3. [What can wait]

## Infrastructure

| Requirement | Specification |
|-------------|---------------|
| CI Tool | [Tool, version] |
| Test DB | [Type, seeding, cleanup] |
| Services | [Required services] |

## Risks

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| Flaky tests | High | Retry logic, isolation |
| Slow execution | Med | Parallelize |

**Known Gaps**: [Limitations and accepted risks]

## Build Handoff

**Commands**: `[test command]` | `[coverage command]`
**Priority**: [Recommended order]

## Review Checklist

Use this checklist when reviewing a test plan:

- [ ] Test levels cover contract, integration, unit, and E2E with coverage targets
- [ ] Framework choices are justified and consistent with project concerns
- [ ] Critical paths (P0) are identified and have 100% coverage requirements
- [ ] Test data strategy covers fixtures, factories, and mocks
- [ ] Coverage requirements have both targets and minimums with enforcement rules
- [ ] Implementation order is justified — what must be tested first and why
- [ ] Infrastructure requirements are specific (tool versions, service deps)
- [ ] Risks include flaky test mitigation and slow execution strategies
- [ ] Known gaps are documented with accepted risk rationale
- [ ] Build handoff commands are concrete and runnable
- [ ] Test plan traces back to acceptance criteria from governing feature specs
- [ ] No untested P0 requirement — every P0 acceptance criterion has a test
