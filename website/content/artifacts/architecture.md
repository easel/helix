# Architecture

HELIX is a methodology and artifact catalog for AI-assisted software teams. It
ships portable content and a single routing skill. Architecturally it is three
things:

1. An **artifact catalog** in `workflows/` — templates, prompts, metadata, and
   examples for every artifact type across the seven HELIX activities.
2. A **routing skill** in `skills/helix/SKILL.md` — the single agent-facing
   surface that reads and writes the catalog's artifact instances.
3. A **methodology specification** in `workflows/` — authority order, activity
   conventions, artifact-type schema, principles, and the alignment skill
   contract, expressed in runtime-neutral terms.

HELIX does not provide a CLI, tracker, queue, or execution loop. Those are
runtime concerns. The boundary between HELIX portable content and any
specific runtime is defined in
[CONTRACT-003](contracts/CONTRACT-003-ddx-adapter-boundary.md).

| Element | Type | Purpose |
|---------|------|---------|
| Software team | Human | Authors governing artifacts; approves plans; steers alignment |
| HELIX routing skill | This system | Single skill entry point: routing, alignment, planning, review |
| Artifact catalog | This system | Canonical artifact type definitions — templates, prompts, metadata |
| Project artifact graph | Per-project | Instances of HELIX artifact types for a specific project |
| Runtime | External | Executes skill sessions; owns tracker, queue, evidence, packaging |

The team never invokes a HELIX command, because there is not one. They invoke
their agent runtime, and the runtime invokes the HELIX routing skill.

| Container | Technology | Responsibilities |
|-----------|------------|-----------------|
| `skills/helix/SKILL.md` | Markdown (skill frontmatter + body) | Single agent-facing surface; all routing modes; reads/writes artifact instances |
| `workflows/activities/` | Markdown + YAML | Artifact type definitions: template, prompt, meta.yml, example per type |
| `workflows/artifact-schema.md` | Markdown spec | Normative schema for `meta.yml` and `ddx:` instance frontmatter |
| `workflows/` (non-activity dirs) | Markdown | Methodology spec: principles, concerns, activity contracts, alignment guidance |
| `docs/helix/` | Markdown + YAML | Project artifact instances; authored from catalog templates |
| Per-runtime packages | Runtime-specific metadata | Thin wrappers that expose same source to DDx, Claude Code, Genie |
| Runtime execution engine | Runtime-specific | Tracker, queue, loop, evidence — outside HELIX boundary |

## Artifact Catalog

The artifact catalog is HELIX's primary structural element. It defines every
artifact type a HELIX-governed project may produce, organized by the seven
HELIX activities:

| Activity | Activity slug | Typical artifact types |
|----------|-----------|------------------------|
| Discover | `00-discover` | Product vision, opportunity brief, constraints |
| Frame | `01-frame` | PRD, feature specs, user stories, risks |
| Design | `02-design` | Architecture, ADRs, solution designs, technical designs, contracts |
| Test | `03-test` | Test plans, test strategies, acceptance criteria |
| Build | `04-build` | Implementation plans, execution documents |
| Deploy | `05-deploy` | Release plans, operations runbooks, rollout docs |
| Iterate | `06-iterate` | Alignment reviews, metrics, retrospectives |

Each artifact type in the catalog provides four files:

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `meta.yml` | Artifact-type metadata per the artifact schema |
| `template.md` | Markdown skeleton for new instances |
| `prompt.md` | Authoring guidance for agents or humans |
| `example.md` | Canonical illustrative instance |

The full `meta.yml` schema — required fields, recommended fields, validation
entries, id-format, dependency declarations, and extension sections — is
specified in [`workflows/artifact-schema.md`](../../../workflows/artifact-schema.md).

### Authority order

Every artifact type declares its position in the authority order. Higher-level
artifacts govern lower-level ones; conflicts resolve upward:

```
product vision
  └─ PRD
       └─ feature specs / user stories
            └─ architecture · ADRs
                 └─ solution designs · technical designs
                      └─ test plans
                           └─ implementation plans · code
```

The routing skill's `evolve` mode threads changes downward through this order;
`align` mode audits consistency across it. Authority order is a HELIX
invariant — no runtime changes it.

### Artifact instance frontmatter

Project artifact instances carry YAML frontmatter under the `ddx:` key. The
namespace is historical (DDx is the reference consumer); it does not mean
artifacts require DDx. Minimal instance frontmatter:

```yaml
---
ddx:
  id: FEAT-001
  type: feature-spec
  depends_on:
    - helix.prd
  status: draft
---
```

`ddx.id` is the only required field. `ddx.depends_on` builds the traceability
graph the routing skill traverses. Full field definitions are in
[`workflows/artifact-schema.md`](../../../workflows/artifact-schema.md).

## Routing Skill

`skills/helix/SKILL.md` is the single agent-facing surface. Any runtime that
loads the skill exposes the same capability set.

### What the skill reads and writes

| Reads | Writes |
|-------|--------|
| Artifact catalog (`workflows/activities/…`) — type definitions, templates, prompts | Project artifact instances (`docs/helix/…`) — new or updated content |
| Project artifact instances — current state of the dependency graph | Alignment reports, work-item descriptions, design documents |
| Methodology docs (`workflows/`) — principles, concerns, activity contracts | Follow-up work descriptions (runtime surfaces these as tracker items, GitHub issues, or markdown stubs) |

The skill never writes to a tracker, queue, or evidence store. Those are runtime
responsibilities.

### Routing modes

| Mode | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `input` | Convert rough intent into governed work |
| `frame` | Create or refine vision, PRD, feature specs, user stories |
| `align` | Identify drift, gaps, and contradictions across the artifact graph |
| `validate` | Check one artifact instance against its type template and prompt |
| `evolve` | Thread a changed requirement through the authority order |
| `design` | Author a technical design before implementation |
| `backfill` | Reconstruct missing artifacts from evidence |
| `review` | Fresh-eyes review of plans, PRs, or recent work |
| `polish` | Refine work items for execution readiness |
| `check` / `next` | Decide the safe next action when intent is ambiguous |
| `build` / `run` | Bounded implementation pass or operator loop (delegates to runtime) |
| `commit` | Commit verified work with traceable message |
| `release` | Cut a HELIX content release |

### Skill composability

The routing skill reads the artifact catalog at runtime; it does not bundle
catalog content inside the skill body. This means:

- Any runtime that installs the HELIX package exposes the same routing modes.
- Catalog updates (new artifact types, revised templates) take effect without
  changing the skill body.
- The skill body contains zero runtime-specific commands (PRD R-4). Per-runtime
  packaging notes live in `docs/install/<runtime>.md`.

The skill's normative behavior is self-contained. Runtimes may surface
additional affordances (bead authoring, execute-loop delegation, prose checking)
through their own packaging layers; those extensions live in per-runtime
packaging, not in the skill body.

## Artifact Schema as Runtime Contract

[`workflows/artifact-schema.md`](../../../workflows/artifact-schema.md)
is the contract that lets any compliant runtime register and consume HELIX
artifact types. A runtime claiming HELIX compatibility must:

1. Read `meta.yml` for artifact-type metadata.
2. Resolve `ddx.id` and `ddx.depends_on` in instance frontmatter for graph
   traversal.
3. Treat `workflows/artifact-schema.md` as the schema authority — not its own
   internal documentation.
4. Preserve unknown fields rather than stripping them.

The schema is intentionally open. Runtimes may add extension fields under `ddx:`
for operational state, but those fields must be ignorable by other runtimes
without changing artifact meaning.

Minimum runtime primitives required to run the alignment skill:

1. Read markdown files from the project filesystem.
2. Write markdown files to the project filesystem.
3. Search files by path or pattern.

Shell execution (item 4) is optional. A runtime satisfying only items 1–3 can
run every HELIX routing mode that does not involve direct code execution.

## Packaging

HELIX ships as three distribution packages around the same source content
(PRD R-7). The source in `workflows/` and `skills/helix/` is never forked.

| Package | Target runtime | Format | Install |
|---------|---------------|--------|---------|
| DDx plugin | DDx | DDx plugin manifest + catalog layout under `.ddx/plugins/helix/` | `ddx install helix` |
| Claude Code skill | Claude Code | Skill frontmatter + symlinked content under `.claude/skills/` | Copy or symlink |
| Databricks Genie skill | Databricks Genie | Genie skill descriptor + bundled catalog | Genie skill loader |

Per-runtime packaging notes — install paths, invocation details, DDx-specific
bead conventions, Genie-specific descriptor fields — live in `docs/install/`.
None of that detail appears in the routing skill body or the artifact catalog.

The adapter boundary between HELIX portable content and DDx-specific surfaces is
specified in [CONTRACT-003](contracts/CONTRACT-003-ddx-adapter-boundary.md).
DDx is one reference runtime, not the architecture center.

## Documentation Projection

HELIX maintains two complementary documentation trees:

| Tree | Role |
|------|------|
| `workflows/` | Methodology specification — artifact-type schema, activity contracts, principles, concerns, alignment guidance. This is the normative content. |
| `docs/helix/` | Dogfood — HELIX's own governing artifacts, authored from HELIX templates. The dogfood is itself subject to alignment skill runs. |

`workflows/` is what adopters install; `docs/helix/` demonstrates the
methodology applied to HELIX's own development. The Hugo microsite (when
generated) is a read-only projection of both trees, not a source of truth.

Methodology invariants — principles, ratchets, activity contracts — are
maintained in `workflows/principles.md` and `workflows/ratchets.md`. Before
relying on either for design decisions, verify the current state in the file;
both are in active flux.

## DDx as One Reference Runtime

DDx is the reference runtime for HELIX's own development. HELIX uses DDx for
bead tracking, execute-loop dispatch, and execution evidence on its own work
items. This is HELIX-using-DDx, not HELIX-coupled-to-DDx — the same
relationship any adopter has with their chosen runtime.

The DDx adapter boundary is defined in
[CONTRACT-003](contracts/CONTRACT-003-ddx-adapter-boundary.md). In brief:

- HELIX provides to DDx: artifact catalog, routing skill, artifact-type schema.
- DDx provides to HELIX (as runtime): bead tracker, execute-loop, evidence
  store, plugin packaging, prose checker.
- Neither side owns the other's internals.

CONTRACT-003 also catalogs known boundary leaks — places in the current
codebase where runtime-specific language has crept into HELIX portable content —
and describes the resolution for each.

## Quality Attributes

| Attribute | Strategy |
|-----------|---------|
| Runtime portability | Skill body and catalog contain zero runtime-specific commands; portability check on every release (PRD R-4) |
| Authority-order coherence | `align` mode audits consistency; `evolve` mode propagates change in authority order |
| Catalog completeness | Seven-activity coverage; each type has template, prompt, meta, example |
| Self-application | `docs/helix/` is authored from HELIX templates; alignment skill runs catch dogfood drift (PRD R-6) |
| Schema openness | Consumers add extension fields; unknown fields are preserved, not stripped |
| Distribution breadth | Three packaging targets (DDx, Claude Code, Genie); source never forked (PRD R-7) |
