# Feature Specification: FEAT-007 — Microsite and Demo Reels

**Feature ID**: FEAT-007
**Status**: Active
**Priority**: P1
**Owner**: HELIX maintainers

## Overview

HELIX needs a public-facing documentation site and scripted demo reels that
show users what HELIX does, how it works, and how to get started. The
microsite is the primary onboarding surface — it must take a new user from
"what is this?" to running `helix run` on their own project.

This feature covers both the Hugo+Hextra microsite (`website/`) and the
reproducible demo reel system (`docs/demos/`). It depends on FEAT-006
because the concern system (hugo-hextra, demo-asciinema) governs the
technology choices and practices for this work.

## Problem Statement

- **Current situation**: HELIX has comprehensive internal workflow docs
  (`workflows/`) but no public-facing site that explains the system to new
  users. The internal docs are written for agents, not humans.
- **Pain points**:
  1. No discoverable entry point — users must read AGENTS.md or workflows/
     to understand HELIX, which is too dense for first contact.
  2. No visual demonstration — text descriptions of the lifecycle are less
     convincing than watching it happen.
  3. No glossary — HELIX introduces many terms (beads, concerns, authority
     order, context digests) that need clear definitions in one place.
  4. No reference for artifact types — users building HELIX projects need
     to know what artifacts exist and when to create them.
- **Desired outcome**: A public site at `easel.github.io/helix/` that
  serves as the primary onboarding and reference surface for HELIX users.

## Functional Requirements

### FR-1: Site Structure

The microsite must include at minimum:

| Section | Purpose | Status |
|---------|---------|--------|
| **Home** | Hero, value prop, feature grid, embedded demo, CTA | Done |
| **Getting Started** | Install and first supervised build in under 10 minutes | Done |
| **Workflow** | Activities, authority order, supervisory loop, stopping conditions | Done |
| **CLI Reference** | Every command with options, env vars, and examples | Done |
| **Skills** | Agent skill listing, installation modes, naming conventions | Done |
| **Glossary** | Definitions for all HELIX terms, organized by category | Done |
| **Demos** | Embedded terminal recordings with run-it-yourself instructions | Done |

### FR-2: Glossary Coverage

The glossary must define every user-facing HELIX concept:

- **Activities**: All 6 lifecycle activities with key artifacts and commands
- **Artifacts**: Every artifact type by activity, with file locations and the
  authority order
- **Actions**: Every supervisory command with usage and behavior
- **Concerns**: The concern library, how filtering works, drift signals
- **Concepts**: Authority order, TDD, context digests, principles, ratchets,
  bounded execution, cross-model verification, epic focus, area taxonomy
- **Tracker**: Beads, labels, queue control, spec-id, dependencies

### FR-3: Demo Reels

Each demo reel must:

- Be fully scripted (no manual recording)
- Run in a Docker container for reproducibility
- Include a narrative structure: Setup → Core Workflow → Verification → Summary
- Produce an asciinema `.cast` file for microsite embedding
- Produce a GIF for README and social contexts
- Include a `README.md` explaining what it demonstrates and how to run it

#### Required Demos

| Demo | Scope | Status |
|------|-------|--------|
| **Quickstart** | Full lifecycle: install → frame → design → build → review | Done |
| **Concerns** | Concern selection during frame, drift detection during review | Done |
| **Evolve** | Threading a requirement change through the artifact stack | Done |
| **Experiment** | Metric-driven optimization loop | Done |

The authoritative shipped public demo inventory is the four demos above.
`docs/demos/helix-interactive/` may exist as an experimental or internal demo
source, but it is out of scope for the public microsite and GitHub Pages
recording workflow unless this feature spec is updated to promote it into the
required demo set.

### FR-4: Technology Stack

The microsite uses:

- **Hugo** (extended edition, pinned version) as static site generator
- **Hextra** theme via Go Module for layout, search, navigation, dark mode
- **Asciinema-player** (v3.7.1) via CDN for terminal recording playback
- **GitHub Pages** for deployment via GitHub Actions
- **Playwright** for e2e testing with screenshot snapshots, video recording

These choices are declared in the `hugo-hextra` and `demo-asciinema`
concerns and must not drift without an ADR.

### FR-5: Content Quality

- Content must be readable as plain markdown on GitHub (not just in Hugo)
- Getting Started must get a user running in under 5 minutes of reading
- CLI Reference must document every command with at least one example
- Glossary definitions must be concise but complete — one table row or
  paragraph per term, not multi-page essays
- Demo pages must embed the recording AND provide run-it-yourself instructions

### FR-6: Deployment

- Site builds via `hugo --gc --minify` with zero errors and zero warnings
- GitHub Actions deploys on successful test + push to main
- Checkout uses `fetch-depth: 0` for git-based last-modified dates
- Concurrent deployment protection prevents race conditions

## Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance**: Site must load in under 2 seconds on a 3G connection
  (Hugo static output achieves this by default)
- **Accessibility**: Hextra theme provides baseline a11y; custom shortcodes
  must not degrade it
- **SEO**: `enableRobotsTXT: true`, proper `<title>` tags, OpenGraph meta
  from Hextra defaults
- **Maintenance**: Content updates should not require Hugo or Go knowledge —
  just edit markdown and push

## User Stories

- US-020: As a developer evaluating HELIX, I want to watch a demo reel so
  I can understand the lifecycle without installing anything.
- US-021: As a new HELIX user, I want a getting-started guide so I can run
  my first supervised build in under 10 minutes.
- US-022: As a HELIX user, I want a glossary so I can look up unfamiliar
  terms without reading the full workflow docs.
- US-023: As a HELIX user building my own project, I want an artifact
  reference so I know what documents to create at each activity.
- US-024: As a HELIX contributor, I want the site to build and deploy
  automatically so I can focus on content, not infrastructure.

## Success Metrics

- Site is live at `easel.github.io/helix/`
- All required sections have substantive content (not stubs)
- Hugo build produces zero errors
- At least one demo reel is embedded and playable
- Glossary covers all terms from `workflows/REFERENCE.md`

## Constraints

- Site content lives in `website/` — not the repo root
- Hugo + Hextra are the only supported site tools (concern: `hugo-hextra`)
- Demo recordings use asciinema only (concern: `demo-asciinema`)
- No custom CSS unless Hextra genuinely cannot achieve the design goal
- No JavaScript beyond what Hextra and the asciinema shortcode provide

## Dependencies

- FEAT-006 (Concerns) — `hugo-hextra` and `demo-asciinema` concerns
  govern technology choices
- DDx (bead tracker) — demo scripts use `ddx bead` commands

## Out of Scope

- Blog or changelog section (may be added in a future iteration)
- Multi-language / i18n support
- Custom theme development beyond shortcodes
- Video (non-terminal) demos
- User accounts or interactive features
- Promoting `docs/demos/helix-interactive/` into the shipped public demo set
  without matching microsite embeds, CI recording coverage, and a feature-spec
  update
